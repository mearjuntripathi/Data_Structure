**Understanding binary representation** is fundamental to bit manipulation. Here's a brief overview to get started:

#### What is Binary Representation?
- In computing, binary is a base-2 numeral system consisting of only two digits: 0 and 1.
- Each digit in a binary number is called a bit (short for binary digit).
- Binary numbers are used by computers because they can represent data using electronic switches, which can be in either an on (1) or off (0) state.

#### Converting Decimal to Binary:
- To convert a decimal number to binary, you repeatedly divide the decimal number by 2 and record the remainders.
- For example, to convert decimal 10 to binary:
  ```
  10 รท 2 = 5 remainder 0
  5 รท 2 = 2 remainder 1
  2 รท 2 = 1 remainder 0
  1 รท 2 = 0 remainder 1
  ```
  So, the binary representation of decimal 10 is 1010.

#### Converting Binary to Decimal:
- To convert a binary number to decimal, you multiply each bit by 2 raised to the power of its position (starting from the rightmost position).
- For example, the binary number 1010:
  ```
  1 * 2^3 + 0 * 2^2 + 1 * 2^1 + 0 * 2^0 = 8 + 0 + 2 + 0 = 10
  ```
  So, the decimal representation of binary 1010 is 10.

#### Binary Representation in Memory:
- In computer memory, data is stored in binary form using sequences of bits.
- Each memory cell can store a fixed number of bits, typically 8 bits (1 byte) or multiples thereof.
- Binary numbers are used to represent various types of data such as integers, characters, and instructions.

Understanding binary representation forms the foundation for working with individual bits and performing bitwise operations. Once you're comfortable with binary representation, we can move on to basic bitwise operations.

Let's dive into some C++ code examples for working with binary representation:

#### Converting Decimal to Binary in C++:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <bitset>

int main() {
    int decimal = 10;
    std::bitset<8> binary(decimal);
    std::cout << "Decimal " << decimal << " is equivalent to binary: " << binary << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```
Output:
```
Decimal 10 is equivalent to binary: 00001010
```

#### Converting Binary to Decimal in C++:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <bitset>

int main() {
    std::bitset<8> binary("1010");
    int decimal = binary.to_ulong();
    std::cout << "Binary 1010 is equivalent to decimal: " << decimal << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```
Output:
```
Binary 1010 is equivalent to decimal: 10
```

These examples demonstrate how to convert between decimal and binary representations using `std::bitset` in C++. You can adjust the number of bits in the `std::bitset` according to your needs.
