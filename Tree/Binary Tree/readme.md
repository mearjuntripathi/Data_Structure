# Binary Tree

A binary tree is a tree data structure in which each node has at most two child nodes, called the left child and the right child. The root node is the topmost node of the tree, and the leaf nodes are the nodes that do not have any child nodes.

Here is a formal definition of a binary tree:

```
A binary tree is a finite set of nodes T = {v1, v2, ..., vn}, where:

* There is a unique node r, called the root of T.
* For each node v in T, there is a unique subset of nodes, called the children of v.
* The children of v are disjoint from each other and from T \ {v}.
* The root has no children.
* Each child of v is either a left child or a right child, but not both.
```

Binary trees are a widely used data structure in computer science. They are used in a variety of applications, such as:

* **Search:** Binary trees can be used to efficiently search for data. This is because the data is organized in a hierarchical manner, so it can be quickly found by traversing the tree from the root node to the leaf node that contains the desired data.
* **Sorting:** Binary trees can be used to sort data. This is because the data can be traversed in a specific order, such as in-order or pre-order, which can be used to sort the data.
* **Algorithms:** Binary trees can be used to implement a variety of algorithms, such as finding the shortest path between two nodes or finding the common ancestor of two nodes.
* **Compression:** Binary trees can be used to compress data. This is because the data can be represented in a hierarchical manner, which can be used to reduce the amount of space required to store the data.
