# [792. Number of Matching Subsequences](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-matching-subsequences/)

Given a string `s` and an array of strings `words`, return the number of `words[i]` that is a subsequence of `s`.

A subsequence of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters (can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters.

For example, `"ace"` is a subsequence of `"abcde"`.
 


**Example 1:**

**Input:** s = "abcde", words = ["a","bb","acd","ace"]<br>
**Output:** 3<br>
**Explanation:** There are three strings in words that are a subsequence of s: "a", "acd", "ace".

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s = "dsahjpjauf", words = ["ahjpjau","ja","ahbwzgqnuk","tnmlanowax"]<br>
**Output:** 2
 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= s.length <= 5 * 1e4`
- `1 <= words.length <= 5000`
- `1 <= words[i].length <= 50`
- `s` and `words[i]` consist of only lowercase English letters.

# Solution
The approach used in the C++ solution you provided for the `numMatchingSubseq` problem is to use a memoization table to store the results of the `substring` function. This allows us to avoid recalculating the same substring multiple times.

The algorithm is as follows:

1. Create a memoization table `mp` to store the results of the `substring` function.
2. Initialize a variable `matched` to keep track of the number of matching words.
3. Iterate over the `words` vector.
    * If the current word is already present in the memoization table, check the value of the corresponding entry.
        * If the value is `true`, then the current word is a matching word. Increment `matched` and continue.
        * If the value is `false`, then the current word is not a matching word. Continue.
    * Otherwise, call the `substring` function to check if the current word is a substring of `s`.
        * If the `substring` function returns `true`, then the current word is a matching word. Increment `matched` and add the current word to the memoization table with a value of `true`.
        * If the `substring` function returns `false`, then the current word is not a matching word. Add the current word to the memoization table with a value of `false`.
4. Return the value of `matched`.

Here is a C++ implementation of the above algorithm:

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    bool substring(string &s, string &word){
        if(s == word) return true;
        if(s.size() < word.size()) return false;
        int cnt = 0;

        for(auto c : s){
            if(c == word[cnt])
                cnt++;
            if(cnt == word.size())
                return true;
        }
        return false;
    }
public:
    int numMatchingSubseq(string s, vector<string>& words) {
        unordered_map<string, bool> mp;
        int matched = 0;
        for(auto &word: words){
            if(mp.count(word)){
                if(mp[word])
                    matched++;
            }else{       
                if(substring(s,word)){
                    matched++;
                    mp[word] = true;
                }else mp[word] = false;
            }

        } 
        return matched;
    }
};
```

This algorithm is time-efficient and space-efficient. It uses O(n * m) time, where `n` is the length of the `s` string and `m` is the length of the `words` vector. It also uses O(m) space to store the memoization table.
