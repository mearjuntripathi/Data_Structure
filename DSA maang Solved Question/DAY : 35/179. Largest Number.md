# [179. Largest Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/largest-number/)

Given a list of non-negative integers `nums`, arrange them such that they form the largest number and return it.

Since the result may be very large, so you need to return a string instead of an integer.

**Example 1:**

>**Input:** nums = [10,2]<br>
**Output:** "210"

**Example 2:**

>**Input:** nums = [3,30,34,5,9]<br>
**Output:** "9534330"
 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 100`
- `0 <= nums[i] <= 1e9`

# Solution

The approach taken by this solution is to sort the integers in the array in such a way that the largest number is formed when the integers are concatenated together. The algorithm for doing this is as follows:

1. Create a vector of strings to store the converted integers.
2. Sort the integers in the array in descending order, using a custom comparator function that compares two integers by concatenating them together and comparing the resulting strings.
3. Iterate over the sorted array and append the string representations of the integers to the largest number string.
4. Return the largest number string, if it is not equal to "0". Otherwise, return "0".

The custom comparator function works by concatenating the string representations of the two integers being compared and comparing the resulting strings. The string representations of the integers are created using the `to_string()` function. The strings are compared using the `<` operator.

The following is a C++ implementation of the `largestNumber()` function:

```c++
string largestNumber(vector<int>& nums) {
  // Sort the integers in the array in descending order, using a custom comparator
  // function that compares two integers by concatenating them together and
  // comparing the resulting strings.
  sort(nums.begin(), nums.end(), [](int& a, int& b) {
    return to_string(a) + to_string(b) > to_string(b) + to_string(a);
  });

  // Iterate over the sorted array and append the string representations of the
  // integers to the largest number string.
  string largest;
  for (auto num : nums) {
    largest += to_string(num);
  }

  // Return the largest number string, if it is not equal to "0". Otherwise,
  // return "0".
  return largest[0] == '0' ? "0" : largest;
}
```

This implementation of the `largestNumber()` function is time-efficient and space-efficient. It uses O(n log n) time to sort the integers and O(n) space to store the converted integers and the largest number string.
