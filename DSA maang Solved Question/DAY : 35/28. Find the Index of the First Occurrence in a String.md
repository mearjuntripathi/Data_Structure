# [28. Find the Index of the First Occurrence in a String](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-index-of-the-first-occurrence-in-a-string/)

Given two strings `needle` and `haystack`, return the index of the first occurrence of `needle` in `haystack`, or `-1` if `needle` is not part of `haystack`.

**Example 1:**

>**Input:** haystack = "sadbutsad", needle = "sad"<br>
**Output:** 0<br>
**Explanation:** "sad" occurs at index 0 and 6.<br>
The first occurrence is at index 0, so we return 0.

**Example 2:**

>**Input:** haystack = "leetcode", needle = "leeto"<br>
**Output:** -1<br>
**Explanation:** "leeto" did not occur in "leetcode", so we return -1.
 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= haystack.length, needle.length <= 1e4`
- `haystack` and `needle` consist of only lowercase English characters.

# Solution

The approach used in the given C++ solution to the `strStr` problem is to iterate over the haystack string, starting at the beginning, and compare each substring of length `n` (the length of the needle string) to the needle string. If a match is found, the index of the matching substring in the haystack string is returned. Otherwise, the loop iterates to the next substring.

The algorithm is as follows:

1. Check if the needle string is longer than the haystack string. If it is, return -1.
2. Check if the haystack string is equal to the needle string. If it is, return 0.
3. Initialize a variable `i` to 0.
4. While `i` is less than or equal to the length of the haystack string minus the length of the needle string:
    * Get the substring of the haystack string starting at index `i` and having a length of `n`.
    * If the substring is equal to the needle string, return `i`.
    * Otherwise, increment `i`.
5. Return -1.

The following is a C++ implementation of the above algorithm:

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int strStr(string &haystack, string &needle) {
        if(needle.size() > haystack.size()) return -1;
        if(haystack == needle) return 0;
        int n = needle.size();
        for(int i = 0 ; i+n <= haystack.size() ; i++){
            if(needle == haystack.substr(i,n))
                return i;
        }
        return -1;
    }
};
```

This algorithm is simple and efficient. It has a time complexity of O(n * m), where `n` is the length of the haystack string and `m` is the length of the needle string. The space complexity of the algorithm is O(1).
