# [852. Peak Index in a Mountain Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/peak-index-in-a-mountain-array/)

An array `arr` is a mountain if the following properties hold:

- `arr.length >= 3`
- There exists some `i` with `0 < i < arr.length - 1` such that:
    - `arr[0] < arr[1] < ... < arr[i - 1] < arr[i]`
    - `arr[i] > arr[i + 1] > ... > arr[arr.length - 1]`

Given a mountain array `arr`, return the index i such that `arr[0] < arr[1] < ... < arr[i - 1] < arr[i] > arr[i + 1] > ... > arr[arr.length - 1]`.

You must solve it in `O(log(arr.length))` time complexity.

**Example 1:**

>**Input:** arr = [0,1,0]<br>
**Output:** 1

**Example 2:**

>**Input:** arr = [0,2,1,0]<br>
**Output:** 1

**Example 3:**

>**Input:** arr = [0,10,5,2]<br>
**Output:** 1
 

**Constraints:**

- `3 <= arr.length <= 1e5`
- `0 <= arr[i] <= 1e6`
- `arr` is guaranteed to be a mountain array.

# Solution

The approach of the solution is to use binary search to find the peak index of the mountain array. The algorithm is as follows:

1. Initialize the low and high pointers to the beginning and end of the array, respectively.
2. While the low pointer is less than or equal to the high pointer:
    * Find the middle index of the array.
    * If the middle element is greater than both its left and right neighbors, then the middle index is the peak index and return it.
    * Otherwise, if the middle element is greater than its left neighbor, then the peak index is in the right half of the array, so set the low pointer to the middle index plus one.
    * Otherwise, the peak index is in the left half of the array, so set the high pointer to the middle index minus one.
3. Once the low pointer is greater than the high pointer, the peak index is not found, so return the low pointer.

Here is a C++ implementation of the algorithm:

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int peakIndexInMountainArray(vector<int>& arr) {
        int low = 0;
        int high = arr.size()-1;

        while(low<=high){
            int mid = low + (high-low)/2;
            if(arr[mid] > arr[mid-1] && arr[mid] > arr[mid+1])
                return mid;
            if(arr[mid] > arr[mid-1])
                low = mid;
            else high = mid;
        }
        return low;
    }
};
```

This algorithm is efficient because it uses binary search to find the peak index of the mountain array in O(log n) time, where n is the length of the array.
