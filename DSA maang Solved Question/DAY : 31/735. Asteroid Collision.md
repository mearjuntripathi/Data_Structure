# [735. Asteroid Collision](https://leetcode.com/problems/asteroid-collision/)

We are given an array `asteroids` of integers representing asteroids in a row.

For each asteroid, the absolute value represents its size, and the sign represents its direction (positive meaning right, negative meaning left). Each asteroid moves at the same speed.

Find out the state of the asteroids after all collisions. If two asteroids meet, the smaller one will explode. If both are the same size, both will explode. Two asteroids moving in the same direction will never meet.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** asteroids = [5,10,-5]<br>
**Output:** [5,10]<br>
**Explanation:** The 10 and -5 collide resulting in 10. The 5 and 10 never collide.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** asteroids = [8,-8]<br>
**Output:** []<br>
**Explanation:** The 8 and -8 collide exploding each other.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** asteroids = [10,2,-5]<br>
**Output:** [10]<br>
**Explanation:** The 2 and -5 collide resulting in -5. The 10 and -5 collide resulting in 10.
 

**Constraints:**

- `2 <= asteroids.length <= 1e4`
- `-1000 <= asteroids[i] <= 1000`
- `asteroids[i] != 0`

# Solution

The approach of the given solution to the Asteroid Collision problem is to use a stack to keep track of the asteroids that are currently moving in the positive direction. When an asteroid moving in the negative direction is encountered, it collides with the asteroid at the top of the stack if it is smaller than or equal in size. If the asteroid moving in the negative direction is larger than the asteroid at the top of the stack, it destroys the asteroid at the top of the stack and continues moving in the negative direction. If the asteroid moving in the negative direction is the same size as the asteroid at the top of the stack, both asteroids are destroyed.

The algorithm for the given solution is as follows:

1. Initialize an empty stack.
2. Iterate over the asteroids in the given array:
    * If the current asteroid is moving in the positive direction, push it onto the stack.
    * If the current asteroid is moving in the negative direction:
        * While the stack is not empty and the asteroid at the top of the stack is smaller than or equal in size to the current asteroid:
            * Pop the asteroid at the top of the stack.
        * If the stack is empty or the asteroid at the top of the stack is larger than the current asteroid, push the current asteroid onto the stack.
3. Clear the given array.
4. While the stack is not empty, pop the asteroid at the top of the stack and push it onto the given array.
5. Reverse the given array.
6. Return the given array.

Here is a C++ implementation of the given algorithm:

```c++
class Solution {
    inline bool check(int v1, int v2){
        if(v1 > 0 && v2 < 0)
            return false;
        return true;
    }
public:
    vector<int> asteroidCollision(vector<int>& asteroids) {
        stack<int> st;
        for(auto &asteroid : asteroids){
            while(!st.empty() && (!check(st.top(), asteroid) && abs(st.top()) < abs(asteroid)))
                st.pop();
            if(!st.empty() && !check(st.top(), asteroid)){
                if(abs(st.top()) == abs(asteroid))
                    st.pop();
            }else st.push(asteroid);
        }
        if(st.empty())
            return {};
        asteroids.clear();
        while(!st.empty()){
            asteroids.push_back(st.top());
            st.pop();
        }
        reverse(asteroids.begin(), asteroids.end());
        return asteroids;
    }
};
```

This C++ implementation of the Asteroid Collision algorithm is time-efficient and space-efficient. It uses O(n) time to iterate over the asteroids and O(n) space to store the stack.
