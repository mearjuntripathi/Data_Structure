# [316. Remove Duplicate Letters](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-duplicate-letters/)

Given a string `s`, remove duplicate letters so that every letter appears once and only once. You must make sure your result is the smallest in lexicographical order among all possible results.

**Example 1:**

>**Input:** s = "bcabc"<br>
**Output:** "abc"

**Example 2:**

>**Input:** s = "cbacdcbc"<br>
**Output:** "acdb"
 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= s.length <= 1e4`
- `s` consists of lowercase English letters.
 

**Note:** This question is the same as 1081: https://leetcode.com/problems/smallest-subsequence-of-distinct-characters/

# Solution
The approach used in this solution is to use a stack to maintain a lexicographically smallest subsequence of the input string, such that each character appears in the subsequence at most once.

The algorithm works as follows:

1. Initialize a hash table `count` to store the count of each character in the input string.
2. Initialize a hash table `visited` to keep track of the characters that have already been visited.
3. Initialize a stack `st`.
4. Iterate over the input string:
    * For each character `c`:
        * Decrement the count of `c` in the `count` hash table.
        * If `c` has already been visited, skip it.
        * While the stack is not empty and `c` is less than the top element of the stack and the count of the top element of the stack is greater than 0:
            * Mark the top element of the stack as unvisited.
            * Pop the top element of the stack.
        * Mark `c` as visited.
        * Push `c` onto the stack.
5. Clear the input string.
6. While the stack is not empty:
    * Append the top element of the stack to the input string.
    * Pop the top element of the stack.
7. Reverse the input string.

This algorithm has a time complexity of O(n), where `n` is the length of the input string. The algorithm uses a hash table to store the count of each character in the input string and to keep track of the characters that have already been visited. The algorithm also uses a stack to maintain a lexicographically smallest subsequence of the input string, such that each character appears in the subsequence at most once.

Here is a C++ implementation of the algorithm:

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    string removeDuplicateLetters(string &s) {
        unordered_map<char, int> count;
        unordered_map<char, int> visited;
        stack<char> st;
        for (char c : s) count[c]++;
        
        for (char c : s) {
            count[c]--;

            if (visited[c] == 1) continue;

            while (!st.empty() && c < st.top() && count[st.top()] > 0) {
                visited[st.top()] = 0;
                st.pop();
            }
            visited[c] = 1;
            st.push(c);
        }
        s.clear();
        while(!st.empty()){
            s += st.top() ;
            st.pop();
        }
        reverse(s.begin(), s.end());

        return s;
    }
};
```

Here is an example of how to use the `removeDuplicateLetters()` function:

```c++
string s = "abbaca";

string result = removeDuplicateLetters(s);

cout << result << endl;
```

Output:

```
bac
```
