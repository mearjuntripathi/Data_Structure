# [112. Path Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/path-sum/)

Given the `root` of a binary tree and an integer `targetSum`, return `true` if the tree has a root-to-leaf path such that adding up all the values along the path equals `targetSum`.

A **leaf** is a node with no children.

 

**Example 1:**

> **Input:** root = [5,4,8,11,null,13,4,7,2,null,null,null,1], targetSum = 22<br>
> **Output:** true<br>
> **Explanation:** The root-to-leaf path with the target sum is shown.

**Example 2:**

> **Input:** root = [1,2,3], targetSum = 5<br>
> **Output:** false<br>
> **Explanation:** There two root-to-leaf paths in the tree:<br>
(1 --> 2): The sum is 3.<br>
(1 --> 3): The sum is 4.<br>
There is no root-to-leaf path with sum = 5.

**Example 3:**

> **Input:** root = [], targetSum = 0<br>
> **Output:** false<br>
> **Explanation:** Since the tree is empty, there are no root-to-leaf paths.
 

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 5000]`.
- `-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000`
- `-1000 <= targetSum <= 1000`

# Solution

The approach of the algorithm is as follows:

1. The function first checks if the root node is null. If it is, then there is no path from the root to a leaf node, so the function returns false.
2. Otherwise, the function subtracts the value of the root node from the target sum.
3. If the left and right child nodes of the root node are both null, then the function returns true if the target sum is now 0. This is because the path from the root to the leaf node is simply the root node itself, and the sum of the values of the nodes on the path is equal to the target sum.
4. Otherwise, the function recursively calls itself on the left and right child nodes of the root node, passing the updated target sum as an argument. The function returns true if either of the recursive calls return true.

Code cpp
```cpp
bool hasPathSum(TreeNode* root, int targetSum) {
    if(root == NULL)    return false;

    targetSum -= root->val;

    if(!root->left && !root->right)
        return targetSum == 0;
        
    return hasPathSum(root->left,targetSum) || 
           hasPathSum(root->right, targetSum);
}
```

Here is a more detailed explanation of the algorithm:

* The function `hasPathSum` takes two parameters: the root node of the binary tree and the target sum.
* The function first checks if the root node is null. If it is, then the function returns false.
* Otherwise, the function subtracts the value of the root node from the target sum.
* If the left and right child nodes of the root node are both null, then the function returns true if the target sum is now 0. This is because the path from the root to the leaf node is simply the root node itself, and the sum of the values of the nodes on the path is equal to the target sum.
* Otherwise, the function recursively calls itself on the left and right child nodes of the root node, passing the updated target sum as an argument. The function returns true if either of the recursive calls return true.
