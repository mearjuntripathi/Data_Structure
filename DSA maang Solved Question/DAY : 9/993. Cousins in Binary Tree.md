# [993. Cousins in Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/cousins-in-binary-tree/)


Given the `root` of a binary tree with unique values and the values of two different nodes of the tree `x` and `y`, return `true` if *the nodes corresponding* to the values `x` and `y` in the tree are cousins, or `false` otherwise.

Two nodes of a binary tree are cousins if they have the same depth with different parents.

Note that in a binary tree, the root node is at the depth `0`, and children of each depth `k` node are at the depth `k + 1`.

 

**Example 1:**

>**Input:** root = [1,2,3,4], x = 4, y = 3<br>
>**Output:** false

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/02/12/q1248-02.png)


>**Input:** root = [1,2,3,null,4,null,5], x = 5, y = 4<br>
>**Output:** true

**Example 3:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/02/13/q1248-03.png)


>**Input:** root = [1,2,3,null,4], x = 2, y = 3
<br> 
>**Output:** false

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[2, 100]`.
- `1 <= Node.val <= 100`
- Each node has a **unique** value.
- `x != y`
- `x` and `y` are exist in the tree.

# Solution

The code I have given me implements the following algorithm to determine if two nodes in a binary tree are cousins:
```cpp
bool isCousins(TreeNode* root, int x, int y) {
    queue<TreeNode*> que;
    que.push(root);
    while(!que.empty()){
        int len = que.size();
        bool xl = false,yl = false;
        while(len--){
            TreeNode* node  = que.front();
            que.pop();
            if(node->val == x) xl = true;
            else if(node->val == y)yl = true;

            if(node->left && node->right){
                if((node->left->val == x && node->right->val == y) || 
                (node->left->val == y && node->right->val == x)) 
                    return false;
            }
            if(node->left) que.push(node->left);
            if(node->right) que.push(node->right);
        }
        if(xl == true && yl == true)
            return true;
        if(xl == true || yl == true)
            return false;
    }
    return false;
}
```

1. Initialize a queue and push the root node into the queue.
2. While the queue is not empty, do the following:
    * Get the front node of the queue and remove it from the queue.
    * Mark the node as visited.
    * If the node's value is equal to either x or y, set the corresponding boolean variable to true.
    * If the node has both a left child and a right child, do the following:
        * Check if the left child's value is equal to x and the right child's value is equal to y, or vice versa. If so, return false.
    * If the node has a left child, push the left child into the queue.
    * If the node has a right child, push the right child into the queue.
3. If both boolean variables are true, return true. Otherwise, return false.

The approach of this algorithm is to use a BFS (breadth-first search) traversal to visit all the nodes in the tree. As we visit each node, we check if the node's value is equal to either x or y. If so, we set the corresponding boolean variable to true. If the node has both a left child and a right child, we check if the left child's value is equal to x and the right child's value is equal to y, or vice versa. If so, we return false because two nodes cannot be cousins if they are siblings.

The time complexity of this algorithm is O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the tree. The space complexity of this algorithm is O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the tree.
