# [108. Convert Sorted Array to Binary Search Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/convert-sorted-array-to-binary-search-tree/)

Given an integer array `nums` where the elements are sorted in ascending order, convert it to a <a title="Height-Balanced
A height-balanced binary tree is a binary tree in which the depth of the two subtrees of every node never differs by more than one.">height-balanced</a> binary search tree.

 

**Example 1:**

> **Input:** nums = [-10,-3,0,5,9]<br>
> **Output:** [0,-3,9,-10,null,5]<br>
> **Explanation:** [0,-10,5,null,-3,null,9] is also accepted:

**Example 2:**

> **Input:** nums = [1,3]<br>
> **Output:** [3,1]<br>
> **Explanation:** [1,null,3] and [3,1] are both height-balanced BSTs.
 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 104`
- `-104 <= nums[i] <= 104`
- `nums` is sorted in a strictly increasing order.

# Solution

The code I have given implements the recursive algorithm for converting a sorted array into a binary search tree (BST). The approach is as follows:

1. The base case is when the array is empty. In this case, the BST is also empty and we return `NULL`.
2. Otherwise, we find the middle element of the array. This element will be the root of the BST.
3. We recursively construct the left subtree of the BST, which consists of all the elements of the array that are less than the middle element.
4. We recursively construct the right subtree of the BST, which consists of all the elements of the array that are greater than the middle element.
5. Finally, we return the root of the BST.

Here is the detailed Code in CPP:

```cpp
class Solution {
    TreeNode* BST(vector<int> &nums, int start, int end);
public:
    TreeNode* sortedArrayToBST(vector<int>& nums) {
        if(nums.size() == 0) return NULL;

        return BST(nums,0,nums.size()-1);
    }
};

TreeNode* Solution :: BST(vector<int> &nums, int start, int end){
    if(start <= end){
        int mid = start + (end-start) / 2;

        TreeNode *branch = new TreeNode(nums[mid]);
        branch->left = BST(nums,start,mid-1);
        branch->right = BST(nums,mid+1,end);
        return branch;
    }
    return NULL;
}
```

The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the array. The space complexity is O(n), which is the space used to store the BST.
