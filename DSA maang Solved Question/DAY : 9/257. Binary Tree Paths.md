# [257. Binary Tree Paths](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-paths/)

Given the `root` of a binary tree, return all *root-to-leaf* paths in **any order**.

A leaf is a node with no children.

 

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/03/12/paths-tree.jpg)

> **Input:** root = [1,2,3,null,5]<br>
> **Output:** ["1->2->5","1->3"]

**Example 2:**

> **Input:** root = [1]<br>
> **Output:** ["1"]
 

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 100]`.
- `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`

# Solution

The code I have provided implements the following algorithm to find all root-to-leaf paths in a binary tree:

```cpp
class Solution {
    void helper(TreeNode * root, vector<string> &s, string str){
        str += to_string(root->val);
        if(root->left)
            helper(root->left,s,str+"->");
        if(root->right)
            helper(root->right,s,str+"->");
        if(!root->left && !root->right){
            s.push_back(str);
        }

    }
public:
    vector<string> binaryTreePaths(TreeNode* root) {
        if(root == NULL)
            return {};
        string str = "";
        vector<string> s;
        helper(root,s,str);
        return s;
    }
};
```

1. The function `binaryTreePaths()` takes the root of the binary tree as input.
2. It first checks if the root is null. If it is, then it returns an empty list.
3. Otherwise, it creates a new empty string `str` and a new empty list `s`.
4. It then calls the recursive helper function `helper()`, passing in the root node, the list `s`, and the string `str`.
5. The helper function `helper()` does the following:
    * Appends the value of the current node to the string `str`.
    * If the left child of the current node is not null, then it calls the recursive helper function again, passing in the left child node, the list `s`, and the string `str` followed by a `"->"` character.
    * If the right child of the current node is not null, then it calls the recursive helper function again, passing in the right child node, the list `s`, and the string `str` followed by a `"->"` character.
    * If the current node is a leaf node (i.e., it has no children), then it appends the string `str` to the list `s`.
6. The function `binaryTreePaths()` returns the list `s`.

Here is an explanation of the algorithm in more detail:

* The base case of the recursion is when the root node is null. In this case, there are no root-to-leaf paths, so the function returns an empty list.
* The recursive case is when the root node is not null. In this case, we need to explore all possible root-to-leaf paths. We do this by first appending the value of the current node to the string `str`. This represents the current path so far.
* Next, we check the left child of the current node. If the left child is not null, then we call the recursive helper function again, passing in the left child node, the list `s`, and the string `str` followed by a `"->"` character. This represents the path that goes from the current node to its left child.
* We do the same thing for the right child of the current node.
* Finally, if the current node is a leaf node (i.e., it has no children), then we have found a root-to-leaf path. We append the string `str` to the list `s`.
* The function `binaryTreePaths()` returns the list `s`, which contains all the root-to-leaf paths in the binary tree.
