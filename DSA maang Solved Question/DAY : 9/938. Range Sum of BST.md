# [938. Range Sum of BST](https://leetcode.com/problems/range-sum-of-bst/)

Given the `root` node of a binary search tree and two integers `low` and `high`, return the sum of values of all nodes with a value in the inclusive range `[low, high]`.

 

**Example 1:**

> **Input:** root = [10,5,15,3,7,null,18], low = 7, high = 15<br>
> **Output:** 32<br>
> **Explanation:** Nodes 7, 10, and 15 are in the range [7, 15]. 7 + 10 + 15 = 32.

**Example 2:**

> **Input:** root = [10,5,15,3,7,13,18,1,null,6], low = 6, high = 10<br>
> **Output:** 23<br>
> **Explanation:** Nodes 6, 7, and 10 are in the range [6, 10]. 6 + 7 + 10 = 23.
 

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 2 * 104]`.
- `1 <= Node.val <= 105`
- `1 <= low <= high <= 105`
- All `Node.val` are unique.

# Solution

The code I provided implements the recursive solution to find the sum of all the nodes in a binary search tree (BST) whose values lie in a given range [low, high].

**The approach is as follows:**

1. Initialize a variable `sum` to 0. This variable will store the sum of all the nodes in the range.
2. Recursively call the `rangeSumBST()` function on the left subtree of the current node, passing in the low and high values.
3. If the current node's value is within the range, add the node's value to the `sum` variable and print the node's value.
4. Recursively call the `rangeSumBST()` function on the right subtree of the current node, passing in the low and high values.
5. Return the value of the `sum` variable.

**Here is an explanation of the code:**

```CPP
int rangeSumBST(TreeNode* root, int low, int high) {
    if(root == NULL) return 0;

    int sum = 0 ;
    sum += rangeSumBST(root->left,low,high);
    
    if(root->val >= low && root->val <= high)
        sum += root->val;
    
    sum += rangeSumBST(root->right,low,high);
    return sum;   
} 
```


* The first line checks if the current node is null. If it is, then the function returns 0.

* The second line initializes a variable `sum` to 0.
* The third line recursively calls the `rangeSumBST()` function on the left subtree of the current node, passing in the low and high values.
* The fourth line checks if the current node's value is within the range. If it is, then the function adds the node's value to the `sum` variable and prints the node's value.
* The fifth line recursively calls the `rangeSumBST()` function on the right subtree of the current node, passing in the low and high values.
* The sixth line returns the value of the `sum` variable.
