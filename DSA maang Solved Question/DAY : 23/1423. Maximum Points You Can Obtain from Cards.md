# [1423. Maximum Points You Can Obtain from Cards](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-points-you-can-obtain-from-cards/)

There are several cards arranged in a row, and each card has an associated number of points. The points are given in the integer array `cardPoints`.

In one step, you can take one card from the beginning or from the end of the row. You have to take exactly `k` cards.

Your score is the sum of the points of the cards you have taken.

Given the integer array `cardPoints` and the integer `k`, return the maximum score you can obtain.

 


**Example 1:**

>**Input:** cardPoints = [1,2,3,4,5,6,1], k = 3<br>
**Output:** 12<br>
**Explanation:** After the first step, your score will always be 1. However, choosing the rightmost card first will maximize your total score. The optimal strategy is to take the three cards on the right, giving a final score of 1 + 6 + 5 = 12.

**Example 2:**

>**Input:** cardPoints = [2,2,2], k = 2<br>
**Output:** 4<br>
**Explanation:** Regardless of which two cards you take, your score will always be 4.

**Example 3:**

>**Input:** cardPoints = [9,7,7,9,7,7,9], k = 7<br>
**Output:** 55<br>
**Explanation:** You have to take all the cards. Your score is the sum of points of all cards.
 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= cardPoints.length <= 1e5`
- `1 <= cardPoints[i] <= 1e4`
- `1 <= k <= cardPoints.length`

# Solution

The approach used in this solution to the Maximum Score of a Subarray of Size K problem is to use a sliding window.

**Algorithm:**

1. Initialize a variable `res` to the sum of the first `k` elements of the array.
2. Initialize a variable `temp` to `res`.
3. Iterate over the array from `k-1` to `0`.
    * Subtract the current element from `temp`.
    * Add the element at index `n-k+i` to `temp`.
    * Update `res` to the maximum of `res` and `temp`.
4. Return `res`.

The following C++ code implements this algorithm:

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int maxScore(vector<int>& cardPoints, int k) {
        int n = cardPoints.size();
        int res = 0;
        for(int i = 0 ; i < k ; i++)
            res += cardPoints[i];
        
        if(k == n)
            return res;

        int temp = res;
        for(int i = k-1 ; i >= 0 ; i--){
            temp -= cardPoints[i];
            temp += cardPoints[n-k+i];
            res = max(res,temp);
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```

This solution is time-efficient and space-efficient. It uses O(k) time and O(1) space.

**Example:**

Consider the following input:

```
cardPoints = [1,2,3,4,5,6,1]
k = 3
```

The algorithm would work as follows:

1. Initialize `res` to the sum of the first `k` elements of the array: `res = 6`.
2. Initialize `temp` to `res`: `temp = 6`.
3. Iterate over the array from `k-1` to `0`:
    * Subtract the current element from `temp`: `temp = 3`.
    * Add the element at index `n-k+i` to `temp`: `temp = 10`.
    * Update `res` to the maximum of `res` and `temp`: `res = 10`.
4. Return `res`: `10`.

Therefore, the maximum score of a subarray of size `k` is `10`.
