# [1004. Max Consecutive Ones III](https://leetcode.com/problems/max-consecutive-ones-iii/)

Given a binary array `nums` and an integer `k`, return the maximum number of consecutive `1`'s in the array if you can flip at most `k` `0`'s.

**Example 1:**

>**Input:** nums = [1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0], k = 2<br>
**Output:** 6<br>
**Explanation:** [1,1,1,0,0,**1**,1,1,1,1,**1**]<br>
Bolded numbers were flipped from 0 to 1. The longest subarray is underlined.

**Example 2:**

>**Input:** nums = [0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1], k = 3<br>
**Output:** 10<br>
**Explanation:** [0,0,1,1,**1**,**1**,1,1,1,**1**,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1]<br>
Bolded numbers were flipped from 0 to 1. The longest subarray is underlined.
 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 105`
- `nums[i]` is either `0` or `1`.
- `0 <= k <= nums.length`

# Solution

The approach used in this solution is to maintain a sliding window of the current subarray. The left pointer of the window is used to keep track of the start of the subarray, while the right pointer is used to keep track of the end of the subarray. We also maintain a count of the number of zeros in the current subarray.

The algorithm works as follows:

1. Initialize the left pointer, right pointer, and zero count to zero.
2. Iterate over the array from left to right.
    * If the current element is zero, increment the zero count.
    * While the zero count is greater than `k`, move the left pointer to the right.
    * Update the maximum length of the subarray with the length of the current subarray.
3. Return the maximum length of the subarray.

Here is the C++ implementation of this algorithm:

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int longestOnes(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        int ml = 0;
        int left = 0; // Left pointer to keep track of the start of the subarray
        int zero = 0; // Count of zeros in the current subarray

        for (int right = 0; right < nums.size(); right++) {
            if (nums[right] == 0) {
                zero++;
            }

            while (zero > k) {
                if (nums[left++] == 0) {
                    zero--;
                }
            }

            ml = max(ml, right - left + 1);
        }

        return ml;
    }
};
```

This algorithm is time-efficient and space-efficient. It uses O(n) time to iterate over the array and O(1) space to maintain the left pointer, right pointer, and zero count.
