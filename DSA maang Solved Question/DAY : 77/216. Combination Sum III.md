# [216. Combination Sum III](https://leetcode.com/problems/combination-sum-iii/)

Find all valid combinations of `k` numbers that sum up to `n` such that the following conditions are true:

- Only numbers `1` through `9` are used.
- Each number is used at most once.

Return a list of all possible valid combinations. The list must not contain the same combination twice, and the combinations may be returned in any order.

**Example 1:**

>**Input:** k = 3, n = 7<br>
**Output:** [[1,2,4]]<br>
**Explanation:**<br>
1 + 2 + 4 = 7<br>
There are no other valid combinations.

**Example 2:**

>**Input:** k = 3, n = 9<br>
**Output:** [[1,2,6],[1,3,5],[2,3,4]]<br>
**Explanation:**<br>
1 + 2 + 6 = 9<br>
1 + 3 + 5 = 9<br>
2 + 3 + 4 = 9<br>
There are no other valid combinations.

**Example 3:**

>**Input:** k = 4, n = 1<br>
**Output:** []<br>
**Explanation:** There are no valid combinations.<br>
Using 4 different numbers in the range [1,9], the smallest sum we can get is 1+2+3+4 = 10 and since 10 > 1, there are no valid combination.
 

**Constraints:**

- `2 <= k <= 9`
- `1 <= n <= 60`

# Solution
Sure, here is a description of the algorithm and approach, as well as the C++ code:

**Algorithm**

The algorithm is a backtracking algorithm. Backtracking is a problem-solving technique that involves exploring all possible solutions in a systematic way. In this case, the algorithm explores all possible combinations of numbers that sum to the target number.

The algorithm starts by initializing an empty vector of vectors to store the combinations. It then initializes an empty vector to store the current combination. The algorithm then calls the `backtracking` function, which recursively explores all possible combinations.

The `backtracking` function takes four arguments:

* `combination`: A vector of vectors to store the combinations.
* `group`: A vector to store the current combination.
* `idx`: The index of the next number to add to the combination.
* `k`: The number of numbers left to add to the combination.
* `n`: The target number.

The `backtracking` function first checks if the current combination is valid. A valid combination is one that has the correct number of numbers and that sums to the target number. If the current combination is valid, then it is added to the vector of vectors of combinations.

The `backtracking` function then recursively calls itself to explore all possible combinations that start with the next number. The `backtracking` function passes the vector of vectors of combinations, the vector to store the current combination, the index of the next number to add to the combination, the number of numbers left to add to the combination, and the target number as arguments.

The `backtracking` function continues to recursively call itself until all possible combinations have been explored.

**Approach**

The approach is to use a backtracking algorithm to explore all possible combinations of numbers that sum to the target number. This approach is efficient because it only explores valid combinations.

**C++ Code**

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> combinationSum3(int k, int n) {
        vector<vector<int>> combinations;
        vector<int> group;
        backtracking(combinations, group, 1, k, n);
        return combinations;
    }

private:
    void backtracking(vector<vector<int>>& combinations, vector<int>& group, int idx, int k, int n) {
        if (k == 0 && n == 0) {
            combinations.push_back(group);
            return;
        }

        for (int i = idx; i <= 9; i++) {
            group.push_back(i);
            backtracking(combinations, group, i + 1, k - 1, n - i);
            group.pop_back();
        }
    }
};
```

I hope this helps!
