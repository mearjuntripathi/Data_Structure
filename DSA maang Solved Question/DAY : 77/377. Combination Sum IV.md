# [377. Combination Sum IV](https://leetcode.com/problems/combination-sum-iv/)

Given an array of distinct integers `nums` and a `target` integer target, return the number of possible combinations that add up to `target`.

The test cases are generated so that the answer can fit in a 32-bit integer.

 


**Example 1:**

>**Input:** nums = [1,2,3], target = 4<br>
**Output:** 7
**Explanation:**<br>
The possible combination ways are:<br>
(1, 1, 1, 1)<br>
(1, 1, 2)<br>
(1, 2, 1)<br>
(1, 3)<br>
(2, 1, 1)<br>
(2, 2)<br>
(3, 1)<br>
Note that different sequences are counted as different combinations.

**Example 2:**

>**Input:** nums = [9], target = 3<br>
**Output:** 0
 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 200`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= 1000`
- All the elements of `nums` are unique.
- `1 <= target <= 1000`
 

**Follow up:** What if negative numbers are allowed in the given array? How does it change the problem? What limitation we need to add to the question to allow negative numbers?

# Solution
Sure!

Here's the algorithm and approach in C++ along with the code, which utilizes memoization to efficiently calculate the number of ways to reach the target sum:

**Algorithm:**
1. Initialize a 2D dynamic programming (DP) table `dp` of size 201x1001, where the rows represent the target sum and the columns represent the index in the nums array.
2. Fill the DP table with -1 to indicate that the corresponding combination has not been calculated yet.
3. Define a recursive function `backtracking(target, nums, idx, dp)` that takes the target sum, nums array, current index, and DP table as parameters.
4. Inside the `backtracking` function, check if the target sum is 0. If so, return 1, indicating that one combination has been found.
5. If the current index has reached the end of the nums array, return 0, indicating that no combination has been found.
6. Check if the value at the current index in the nums array is less than or equal to the target sum. If so, call the `backtracking` function recursively for the remaining target sum and the updated index, incrementing the count of valid combinations.
7. Call the `backtracking` function recursively for the remaining target sum and the next index, without incrementing the count of valid combinations.
8. Return the sum of the counts from both recursive calls.
9. In the main function, initialize the nums array and target sum.
10. Call the `combinationSum4` function to calculate the number of valid combinations and return the result.

**Approach:**
This approach employs memoization to store the results of previously calculated combinations, avoiding redundant computations. The DP table is used to store the number of valid combinations for each target sum and index in the nums array. This optimization significantly reduces the time complexity of the algorithm.

**Code:**

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int backtracking(int target, vector<int>& nums, int idx, vector<vector<int>>& dp){
        if(target == 0) return 1;
        if(idx == nums.size()) return 0;

        if(dp[idx][target] != -1) return dp[idx][target];
        int pick = 0;
        if(nums[idx] <= target)
            pick = backtracking(target-nums[idx], nums, idx, dp);
        int notpick = backtracking(target, nums, idx + 1, dp);

        return dp[idx][target] = pick + notpick;
    }

public:
    int combinationSum4(vector<int>& nums, int target) {
        vector<vector<int>> dp(201, vector<int>(1001, -1));
        return backtracking(target, nums, 0, dp);
    }
};
```

This code effectively calculates the number of valid combinations using memoization and dynamic programming, providing an efficient solution to the problem.
