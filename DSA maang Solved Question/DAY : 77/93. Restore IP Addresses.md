# [93. Restore IP Addresses](https://leetcode.com/problems/restore-ip-addresses/)

A valid IP address consists of exactly four integers separated by single dots. Each integer is between `0` and `255` (inclusive) and cannot have leading zeros.

- For example, `"0.1.2.201"` and `"192.168.1.1"` are valid IP addresses, but `"0.011.255.245"`, `"192.168.1.312"` and `"192.168@1.1"` are invalid IP addresses.

Given a string `s` containing only digits, return all possible valid IP addresses that can be formed by inserting dots into `s`. You are not allowed to reorder or remove any digits in `s`. You may return the valid IP addresses in any order.

**Example 1:**

>**Input:** s = "25525511135"<br>
**Output:** ["255.255.11.135","255.255.111.35"]

**Example 2:**

>**Input:** s = "0000"<br>
**Output:** ["0.0.0.0"]

**Example 3:**

>**Input:** s = "101023"<br>
**Output:** ["1.0.10.23","1.0.102.3","10.1.0.23","10.10.2.3","101.0.2.3"]
 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= s.length <= 20`
- `s` consists of digits only.

# Solution

Sure, here is the algorithm and approach for the problem of restoring IP addresses from a given string, along with the C++ code:

**Algorithm**

The algorithm to restore IP addresses from a given string is a backtracking algorithm. The basic idea is to try all possible combinations of three dots to divide the string into four segments. Each segment must be a valid IP address segment, which means it must be between 0 and 255, inclusive, and it cannot start with a 0 if it has more than one digit.

Here is the algorithm in more detail:

1. Start with an empty string `ip_address` and a vector of strings `ip_addresses`.
2. Recursively call the `backtracking` function with the remaining string, the current index, the current `ip_address`, and the remaining number of dots.
3. In the `backtracking` function, check if the remaining string is too short to be a valid IP address. If so, return.
4. For each possible length of the next segment (between 1 and 3, inclusive), create a substring of that length from the remaining string.
5. Check if the substring is a valid IP address segment. If so, add it to the `ip_address` and recursively call the `backtracking` function with the remaining string, the current index, the updated `ip_address`, and the remaining number of dots.
6. After the recursive call returns, remove the last segment from the `ip_address`.
7. After all possible combinations of dots have been tried, return the `ip_addresses` vector.

**Approach**

The approach to solving this problem is to use a backtracking algorithm to try all possible combinations of three dots to divide the string into four segments. This approach is efficient because it only tries the combinations that are valid, and it does not need to generate all possible combinations beforehand.

**C++ Code**

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    bool isValidSegment(string s) {
        if (s.size() > 3 || (s[0] == '0' && s.size() > 1)) {
            return false;
        }

        int num = stoi(s);
        if (num > 255) {
            return false;
        }
        return true;
    }

    void backtracking(string& s, int i, string ip_address, vector<string>& ip_addresses, int dots) {
        int n = s.size();
        if (dots == 0) {
            // make substring from i+1 till n-1 and check if valid
            // if valid then add it to answer and return
            string substr = s.substr(i + 1, n - i + 1);
            if (substr == "") {
                return;
            }
            if (isValidSegment(substr)) {
                ip_address += substr;
                ip_addresses.push_back(ip_address);
            }
            return;
        }

        string seg = "";
        // start adding the dots after minLen digits
        for (int j = i + 1; j <= i + 3 && j < n; j++) {
            seg += s[j];
            ip_address += s[j];
            if (isValidSegment(seg)) {
                ip_address += '.';
                // cout<<temp<<" ";
                backtracking(s, j, ip_address, ip_addresses, dots - 1);
            } else {
                return;
            }
            ip_address.pop_back();
        }
    }

    vector<string> restoreIpAddresses(string s) {
        int n = s.size();
        int dots = 3;

        vector<string> ip_addresses;
        string ip_address = "";

        backtracking(s, -1, ip_address, ip_addresses, dots);

        return ip_addresses;
    }
};
```

This code will print all possible valid IP addresses that can be formed from the given string.
