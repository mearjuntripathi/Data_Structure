# [986. Interval List Intersections](https://leetcode.com/problems/interval-list-intersections/)

You are given two lists of closed intervals, `firstList` and `secondList`, where `firstList[i] = [starti, endi]` and s`econdList[j] = [startj, endj]`. Each list of intervals is pairwise **disjoint** and in sorted order.

*Return the intersection of these two interval lists.*

A **closed interval** `[a, b]` (with `a <= b`) denotes the set of real numbers `x` with `a <= x <= b`.

The intersection of two closed intervals is a set of real numbers that are either empty or represented as a closed interval. For example, the intersection of `[1, 3]` and `[2, 4]` is `[2, 3]`.

 


**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/01/30/interval1.png)

>**Input:** firstList = [[0,2],[5,10],[13,23],[24,25]], secondList = [[1,5],[8,12],[15,24],[25,26]]<br>
**Output:** [[1,2],[5,5],[8,10],[15,23],[24,24],[25,25]]

**Example 2:**

>**Input:** firstList = [[1,3],[5,9]], secondList = []<br>
**Output:** []
 

**Constraints:**

- `0 <= firstList.length, secondList.length <= 1000`
- `firstList.length + secondList.length >= 1`
- `0 <= starti < endi <= 10^9`
- `endi < starti+1`
- `0 <= startj < endj <= 10^9`
- `endj < startj+1`

# Solution

This solution to the Interval Intersection problem uses a greedy approach.

**Approach:**

1. Sort the two lists of intervals by their start times.
2. Initialize two pointers, `i` and `j`, to the beginning of the two lists, respectively.
3. Initialize the result list.
4. While `i` is less than the length of the first list and `j` is less than the length of the second list:
    * If the two intervals at `i` and `j` overlap, add the intersection of the two intervals to the result list.
    * Move the pointer to the interval that ends sooner.
5. Return the result list.

**Algorithm:**

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> intervalIntersection(vector<vector<int>>& firstList, vector<vector<int>>& secondList) {
        if(firstList.empty())
            return {};
        if(secondList.empty())
            return {};
        
        vector<vector<int>> intersect;

        int i = 0;
        int j = 0;
        while(i < firstList.size() && j < secondList.size()){
            int l = max(firstList[i][0],secondList[j][0]);
            int r = min(firstList[i][1],secondList[j][1]);
            if(l <= r)
                intersect.push_back({l,r});
            (firstList[i][1] < secondList[j][1]) ? i++ : j++;
        }
        return intersect;
    }
};
```

This solution is efficient both in terms of time and space. It uses O(n log n) time to sort the two lists of intervals and O(1) space to store the result list.
