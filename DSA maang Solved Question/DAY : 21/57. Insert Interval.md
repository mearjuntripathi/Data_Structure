# [57. Insert Interval](https://leetcode.com/problems/insert-interval/)

You are given an array of non-overlapping intervals intervals where `intervals[i] = [starti, endi]` represent the start and the end of the `ith` interval and intervals is sorted in ascending order by `starti`. You are also given an interval `newInterval = [start, end]` that represents the start and end of another interval.

Insert `newInterval` into `intervals` such that intervals is still sorted in ascending order by `starti` and `intervals` still does not have any overlapping intervals (merge overlapping intervals if necessary).

Return `intervals` after the insertion.


**Example 1:**

>**Input:** intervals = [[1,3],[6,9]], newInterval = [2,5]<br>
**Output:** [[1,5],[6,9]]

**Example 2:**

>**Input:** intervals = [[1,2],[3,5],[6,7],[8,10],[12,16]], newInterval = [4,8]<br>
**Output:** [[1,2],[3,10],[12,16]]<br>
**Explanation:** Because the new interval [4,8] overlaps with [3,5],[6,7],[8,10].
 

**Constraints:**

- `0 <= intervals.length <= 10^4`
- `intervals[i].length == 2`
- `0 <= starti <= endi <= 10^5`
- `intervals is sorted by starti in ascending order.`
- `newInterval.length == 2`
- `0 <= start <= end <= 10^5`

# Solution

The approach and algorithm of the given solution to the `insert` problem are as follows:

**Approach:**

The approach is to iterate over the given intervals, and insert the new interval at the appropriate position. If the new interval overlaps with any of the existing intervals, then the overlapping intervals are merged.

**Algorithm:**

1. Initialize a result vector.
2. Set a flag `inserted` to `false`.
3. Iterate over the given intervals:
    * If the current interval overlaps with the new interval, and the `inserted` flag is `false`:
        * Merge the current interval with the new interval.
        * Set the `inserted` flag to `true`.
    * Otherwise:
        * Add the current interval to the result vector.
4. If the `inserted` flag is `false`:
    * Add the new interval to the result vector.
5. Return the result vector.

**Pseudocode:**

```
def insert(intervals, newInterval):
  """Inserts a new interval into a list of intervals.

  Args:
    intervals: A list of intervals, where each interval is a list of two
      integers, representing the start and end times of the interval.
    newInterval: A list of two integers, representing the start and end times of
      the new interval.

  Returns:
    A list of intervals, with the new interval inserted.
  """

  result = []
  inserted = False

  for interval in intervals:
    if interval[0] <= newInterval[1] and newInterval[0] <= interval[1] and not inserted:
      newInterval = [min(interval[0], newInterval[0]), max(interval[1], newInterval[1])]
      inserted = True
    else:
      result.append(interval)

  if not inserted:
    result.append(newInterval)

  return result
```

**C++ code:**

```c++
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

vector<vector<int>> insert(vector<vector<int>>& intervals, vector<int>& newInterval) {
  vector<vector<int>> result;
  bool inserted = false;

  for (const auto& interval : intervals) {
    if (interval[0] <= newInterval[1] and newInterval[0] <= interval[1] and not inserted) {
      newInterval = {min(interval[0], newInterval[0]), max(interval[1], newInterval[1])};
      inserted = true;
    } else {
      result.push_back(interval);
    }
  }

  if (not inserted) {
    result.push_back(newInterval);
  }

  return result;
}
```

This solution is efficient in terms of time and space complexity. It uses O(n) time and O(n) space to insert the new interval into the list of intervals.
