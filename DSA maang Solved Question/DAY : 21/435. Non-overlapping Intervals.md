! [435. Non-overlapping Intervals](435.%20Non-overlapping%20Intervals.md)

Given an array of `intervals` intervals where `intervals[i] = [starti, endi]`, return the minimum number of intervals you need to remove to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping.

 


**Example 1:**

>**Input:** intervals = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[1,3]]<br>
**Output:** 1<br>
**Explanation:** [1,3] can be removed and the rest of the intervals are non-overlapping.

**Example 2:**

>**Input:** intervals = [[1,2],[1,2],[1,2]]<br>
**Output:** 2<br>
**Explanation:** You need to remove two [1,2] to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping.

**Example 3:**

>**Input:** intervals = [[1,2],[2,3]]<br>
**Output:** 0<br>
**Explanation:** You don't need to remove any of the intervals since they're already non-overlapping.
 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= intervals.length <= 10^5`
- `intervals[i].length == 2`
- `-5 * 10^4 <= starti < endi <= 5 * 10^4`

# Solution

This solution to the Erase Overlapping Intervals problem uses a greedy algorithm. The algorithm works as follows:

1. Sort the intervals by their start times.
2. Initialize a pointer, `i`, to the beginning of the intervals list.
3. Initialize a counter, `minLap`, to 0.
4. While `i` is less than the length of the intervals list:
    * If the current interval overlaps with the next interval, remove the current interval and increment `minLap`.
    * Otherwise, move `i` to the next interval.
5. Return `minLap`.

The algorithm is greedy because it always removes the current interval if it overlaps with the next interval. This is not necessarily the optimal solution, but it is a simple and efficient solution.

**Algorithm:**

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int eraseOverlapIntervals(vector<vector<int>>& intervals) {
        if(intervals.size() <= 1) return 0;
        
        sort(intervals.begin(), intervals.end());

        int minLap = 0;
        for(int i = intervals.size() - 2, border = intervals[i + 1][0]; i >= 0; i--){
            if(intervals[i][1] > border)
                minLap++;
            else
                border = intervals[i][0];
        }        
        return minLap;
    }
};
```

This algorithm is efficient because it only needs to iterate over the intervals list once. It also has a good time complexity of O(n log n), where `n` is the number of intervals.
