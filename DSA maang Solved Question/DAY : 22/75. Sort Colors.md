# [75. Sort Colors](https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-colors/)

Given an array `nums` with `n` objects colored red, white, or blue, sort them [in-place](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm) so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white, and blue.

We will use the integers `0`, `1`, and `2` to represent the color red, white, and blue, respectively.

You must solve this problem without using the library's sort function.


**Example 1:**

> **Input:** nums = [2,0,2,1,1,0]<br>
**Output:** [0,0,1,1,2,2]

**Example 2:**

> **Input:** nums = [2,0,1]<br>
**Output:** [0,1,2]
 

**Constraints:**

- `n == nums.length`
- `1 <= n <= 300`
- `nums[i] is either 0, 1, or 2.`
 

**Follow up:** Could you come up with a one-pass algorithm using only constant extra space?

# Solution

The solution to the sort colors problem in C++ that you provided has two approaches:

**Approach 1: Counting Sort**

This approach uses O(n) time and O(n) space.

1. Initialize two counters, `zero` and `one`, to count the number of zeros and ones in the input array, respectively.
2. Iterate over the input array and update the counters accordingly.
3. Iterate over the input array again, starting from index 0.
    * If the `zero` counter is greater than 0, set the current element to 0 and decrement the `zero` counter.
    * Otherwise, if the `one` counter is greater than 0, set the current element to 1 and decrement the `one` counter.
    * Otherwise, set the current element to 2.

**Algorithm:**

```c++
void sortColors(vector<int>& nums) {
  // Initialize two counters, `zero` and `one`, to count the number of zeros and ones
  // in the input array, respectively.
  int zero = 0;
  int one = 0;

  // Iterate over the input array and update the counters accordingly.
  for (auto num : nums) {
    if (num == 0) {
      zero++;
    } else if (num == 1) {
      one++;
    }
  }

  // Iterate over the input array again, starting from index 0.
  for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++) {
    // If the `zero` counter is greater than 0, set the current element to 0 and
    // decrement the `zero` counter.
    if (zero > 0) {
      nums[i] = 0;
      zero--;
    }
    // Otherwise, if the `one` counter is greater than 0, set the current element
    // to 1 and decrement the `one` counter.
    else if (one > 0) {
      nums[i] = 1;
      one--;
    }
    // Otherwise, set the current element to 2.
    else {
      nums[i] = 2;
    }
  }
}
```

**Approach 2: Three-Pointer Partition**

This approach uses O(n) time and O(1) space.

1. Initialize three pointers, `s`, `m`, and `e`, to the beginning, middle, and end of the input array, respectively.
2. While `m` is less than or equal to `e`:
    * If `nums[m]` is 0, swap `nums[m]` and `nums[s]`, and increment `s` and `m`.
    * If `nums[m]` is 1, increment `m`.
    * Otherwise, swap `nums[m]` and `nums[e]`, and decrement `e`.

**Algorithm:**

```c++
void sortColors(vector<int>& nums) {
  // Initialize three pointers, `s`, `m`, and `e`, to the beginning, middle, and end
  // of the input array, respectively.
  int s = 0;
  int m = 0;
  int e = nums.size() - 1;

  // While `m` is less than or equal to `e`:
  while (m <= e) {
    // If `nums[m]` is 0, swap `nums[m]` and `nums[s]`, and increment `s` and `m`.
    if (nums[m] == 0) {
      swap(nums[m++], nums[s++]);
    }
    // If `nums[m]` is 1, increment `m`.
    else if (nums[m] == 1) {
      m++;
    }
    // Otherwise, swap `nums[m]` and `nums[e]`, and decrement `e`.
    else {
      swap(nums[m], nums[e--]);
    }
  }
}
```

Which approach to use depends on the specific requirements of the problem. If space is a constraint, then Approach 2 is a good choice. However, if time is a constraint, then Approach 1 may be a better choice.
