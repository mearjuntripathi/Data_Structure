# [11. Container With Most Water](https://leetcode.com/problems/container-with-most-water/)

You are given an integer array `height` of length `n`. There are `n` vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the `ith` line are `(i, 0)` and `(i, height[i])`.

Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Return the *maximum amount of water a container can store*.

**Notice** that you may not slant the container.

 


**Example 1:**

> **Input:** height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]<br>
**Output:** 49<br>
**Explanation:** The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.

**Example 2:**

> **Input:** height = [1,1]<br>
**Output:** 1
 

**Constraints:**

- `n == height.length`
- `2 <= n <= 1e5`
- `0 <= height[i] <= 1e4`

# Solution

The approach of this solution is to use two pointers, `left` and `right`, to traverse the `height` array. At each step, we calculate the area of the rectangle formed by the two pointers and the minimum height between them. We then update the maximum area if necessary and move the pointer with the smaller height one step inwards.

The algorithm is as follows:

1. Initialize `left` to 0 and `right` to the length of the `height` array minus 1.
2. Initialize `maxArea` to 0.
3. While `left` is less than `right`:
    * Calculate the area of the rectangle formed by `left`, `right`, and the minimum height between them.
    * Update `maxArea` if necessary.
    * Move the pointer with the smaller height one step inwards.
4. Return `maxArea`.

Here is a C++ implementation of the algorithm:

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int maxArea(vector<int>& height) {
        int left = 0;
        int right = height.size() - 1;
        int maxArea = 0;

        while (left < right) {
            int width = right - left;
            int contain = min(height[left], height[right]) * width;

            maxArea = max(maxArea, contain);

            height[left] > height[right] ? right-- : left++;
        }

        return maxArea;
    }
};
```

This algorithm is time-efficient and space-efficient. It uses O(n) time to traverse the `height` array and O(1) space to store the two pointers.
