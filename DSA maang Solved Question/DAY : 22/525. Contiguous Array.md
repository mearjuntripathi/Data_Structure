# [525. Contiguous Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/contiguous-array/)

Given a binary array `nums`, return the maximum length of a contiguous subarray with an equal number of `0` and `1`.

 

**Example 1:**

>**Input:** nums = [0,1]<br>
**Output:** 2<br>
**Explanation:** [0, 1] is the longest contiguous subarray with an equal number of 0 and 1.
**Example 2:**

>**Input:** nums = [0,1,0]<br>
**Output:** 2<br>
**Explanation:** [0, 1] (or [1, 0]) is a longest contiguous subarray with equal number of 0 and 1.
 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 1e5`
- `nums[i]` is either `0` or `1`.

# Solution

The approach used in this C++ solution to the Longest Subarray with Equal Numbers of 0s and 1s problem is to use a hash table to store the cumulative sum of the elements in the array up to each index. The key of the hash table is the cumulative sum, and the value is the index of the element in the array where the cumulative sum occurs.

The algorithm works as follows:

1. Initialize a hash table, `mp`, with the key-value pair `(0, -1)`. This indicates that the cumulative sum of the elements in the array up to index -1 is 0.
2. Initialize a variable, `sum`, to 0.
3. Iterate over the elements in the array:
    * For each element, `nums[i]`:
        * Increment `sum` by 1 if `nums[i]` is 1, or decrement `sum` by 1 if `nums[i]` is 0.
        * Check if `mp` contains the key `sum`. If it does, then there is a subarray from index `mp[sum] + 1` to index `i` (inclusive) that has an equal number of 0s and 1s. Update the maximum length of the subarray, `maxL`, accordingly.
        * If `mp` does not contain the key `sum`, then add the key-value pair `(sum, i)` to the hash table.
4. Return the maximum length of the subarray, `maxL`.

Here is a C++ implementation of the algorithm:

```c++
class Solution {
public:
  int findMaxLength(vector<int>& nums) {
    unordered_map<int, int> mp{{0, -1}};
    int sum = 0;
    int maxL = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++) {
      sum += nums[i] > 0 ? 1 : -1;
      if (mp.count(sum)) {
        maxL = max(maxL, i - mp[sum]);
      } else {
        mp[sum] = i;
      }
    }
    return maxL;
  }
};
```

This algorithm is efficient in both time and space. It takes O(n) time to iterate over the elements in the array and O(n) space to store the hash table.
