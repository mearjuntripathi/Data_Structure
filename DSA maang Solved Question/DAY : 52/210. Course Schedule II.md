# [210. Course Schedule II](https://leetcode.com/problems/course-schedule-ii/)

There are a total of `numCourses` courses you have to take, labeled from `0` to `numCourses - 1`. You are given an array `prerequisites` where `prerequisites[i] = [ai, bi]` indicates that you must take course `bi` first if you want to take course `ai`.

- **For example**, the pair `[0, 1]`, indicates that to take course `0` you have to first take course `1`.

Return the ordering of courses you should take to finish all courses. If there are many valid answers, return any of them. If it is impossible to finish all courses, return **an empty array**.

**Example 1:**

>**Input:** numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0]]<br>
**Output:** [0,1]<br>
**Explanation:** There are a total of 2 courses to take. To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So the correct course order is [0,1].

**Example 2:**

>**Input:** numCourses = 4, prerequisites = [[1,0],[2,0],[3,1],[3,2]]<br>
**Output:** [0,2,1,3]<br>
**Explanation:** There are a total of 4 courses to take. To take course 3 you should have finished both courses 1 and 2. Both courses 1 and 2 should be taken after you finished course 0.<br>
So one correct course order is [0,1,2,3]. Another correct ordering is [0,2,1,3].

**Example 3:**

>**Input:** numCourses = 1, prerequisites = []<br>
**Output:** [0]
 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= numCourses <= 2000`
- `0 <= prerequisites.length <= numCourses * (numCourses - 1)`
- `prerequisites[i].length == 2`
- `0 <= ai, bi < numCourses`
- `ai != bi`
- All the pairs `[ai, bi]` are **distinct**.

# Solution

## Approach

The approach used in this solution is to use a **depth-first search** (DFS) to find a topological ordering of the courses. A topological ordering of a directed acyclic graph (DAG) is a linear ordering of the vertices such that for every directed edge uv, vertex u comes before v in the ordering.

## Algorithm

The algorithm works as follows:

1. Create an adjacency list for the graph.
2. Initialize two visited arrays, `visited` and `notVisited`, to keep track of which nodes have been visited and which nodes have not been visited yet.
3. Create a stack `result` to store the topological ordering of the courses.
4. Start a DFS from any node in the graph.
5. In the DFS, visit all of the unvisited neighbors of the current node.
6. If the DFS encounters a node that has already been visited, then the graph contains a cycle and there is no topological ordering.
7. Once the DFS has finished exploring all of the nodes in the graph, push the current node onto the stack `result`.
8. Repeat steps 4-7 until all of the nodes in the graph have been visited.
9. Reverse the stack `result` to get the topological ordering of the courses.

## C++ Implementation

The following is a C++ implementation of the algorithm described above:

```c++
class Solution {
    bool dfs(vector<int> adj[], vector<bool> &visited, vector<bool> &notVisited, vector<int> &result, const int &node){
        if(notVisited[node])
            return true;
        if(visited[node])
            return false;
        
        visited[node] = notVisited[node] = true;

        for(auto &n : adj[node])
            if(dfs(adj, visited, notVisited, result, n))
                return true;
        
        notVisited[node] = false;
        result.push_back(node);
        return false;
    }
public:
    vector<int> findOrder(const int &numCourses, vector<vector<int>>& prerequisites) {
        vector<int> adj[numCourses];

        for(auto it : prerequisites){
            adj[it[1]].push_back(it[0]);
        }

        vector<bool> visited(numCourses, false), notVisited(numCourses, false);
        vector<int> result;

        for(int node = 0 ; node < numCourses ; node++){
            if(!visited[node] && dfs(adj, visited, notVisited, result, node))
                return {};
        }
        reverse(result.begin(), result.end());
        return result;
    }
};
```

## Example Usage

The following is an example of how to use the `findOrder()` function:

```c++
Solution solution;

vector<vector<int>> prerequisites = {{1, 0}, {2, 0}, {3, 1}, {3, 2}};
vector<int> order = solution.findOrder(4, prerequisites);

if (order.empty()) {
  cout << "No topological ordering exists." << endl;
} else {
  cout << "A topological ordering is: ";
  for (int i = 0; i < order.size(); i++) {
    cout << order[i] << " ";
  }
  cout << endl;
}
```

Output:

```
A topological ordering is: 0 1 2 3
```
