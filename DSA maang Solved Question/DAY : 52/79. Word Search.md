# [79. Word Search](https://leetcode.com/problems/word-search/)

Given an `m x n` grid of characters `board` and a string `word`, return `true` if word exists in the grid.

The word can be constructed from letters of sequentially adjacent cells, where adjacent cells are horizontally or vertically neighboring. The same letter cell may not be used more than once.

 


**Example 1:**

>**Input:** board = [["A","B","C","E"],["S","F","C","S"],["A","D","E","E"]], word = "ABCCED"<br>
**Output:** true

**Example 2:**

>**Input:** board = [["A","B","C","E"],["S","F","C","S"],["A","D","E","E"]], word = "SEE"<br>
**Output:** true

**Example 3:**

>**Input:** board = [["A","B","C","E"],["S","F","C","S"],["A","D","E","E"]], word = "ABCB"<br>
**Output:** false
 

Constraints:

- `m == board.length`
- `n = board[i].length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 6`
- `1 <= word.length <= 15`
- `board` and `word` consists of only lowercase and uppercase English letters.

# Solution

The approach of the solution is to use a depth-first search (DFS) to traverse the board and look for a path that spells out the word. The DFS algorithm starts at a given cell and recursively explores all of its neighbors. If a neighbor matches the next letter of the word, the DFS algorithm continues to explore that neighbor. If the DFS algorithm reaches the end of the word, then the word has been found.

The algorithm for the solution is as follows:

```c++
class Solution {
    string word;
    int row,col;
    bool DFS(const int &i, const int &j, const int &idx, vector<vector<char>>& board){
        if(idx == word.length()) return true;

        if(i < 0 || j < 0 || i >= row || j >= col || board[i][j] != word[idx]) return false;

        char ch = board[i][j];
        board[i][j] = ' ';

        bool found = DFS(i-1, j, idx+1, board) || 
                     DFS(i, j-1, idx+1, board) || 
                     DFS(i+1, j, idx+1, board) || 
                     DFS(i, j+1, idx+1, board);
        board[i][j] = ch;
        return found;                
    }
public:
    bool exist(vector<vector<char>>& board, string &word) {
        if(word == "") return true;

        this->word = word;
        row = board.size();
        col = board[0].size();
        for(int i = 0 ; i < row ; i++){
            for(int j = 0 ; j < col ; j++){
                if(board[i][j] == word[0])
                    if(DFS(i,j,0,board)) return true;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
};
```

The DFS algorithm is implemented in the `DFS()` function. This function takes four arguments:

* `i`: The row index of the current cell.
* `j`: The column index of the current cell.
* `idx`: The index of the next letter of the word to look for.
* `board`: The board to search.

The `DFS()` function returns `true` if the word has been found, and `false` otherwise.

The main function of the solution is the `exist()` function. This function takes two arguments:

* `board`: The board to search.
* `word`: The word to look for.

The `exist()` function returns `true` if the word has been found in the board, and `false` otherwise.

To use the solution, simply create a new instance of the `Solution` class and call the `exist()` function with the board and word to search for.
