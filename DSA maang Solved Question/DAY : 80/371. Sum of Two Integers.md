# [371. Sum of Two Integers](https://leetcode.com/problems/sum-of-two-integers/)

Given two integers `a` and `b`, return the sum of the two integers without using the operators `+` and `-`.

**Example 1:**

>**Input:** a = 1, b = 2<br>
**Output:** 3

**Example 2:**

>**Input:** a = 2, b = 3<br>
**Output:** 5
 

**Constraints:**

- `-1000 <= a, b <= 1000`

# Solution
**Algorithm**

The algorithm for finding the sum of two integers without using the '+' operator is a bitwise operation that relies on the XOR and AND operators. The algorithm works by repeatedly XORing the two numbers together and then shifting the result left by one bit. This process is continued until the second number becomes zero. The final result is the XOR of the two numbers at the end of the loop.

```
Algorithm: getSum(a, b)

  1. Initialize a temporary variable `temp` to 0.
  2. While `b` is not equal to 0:
    a. Perform a bitwise XOR (^) operation on `a` and `b`, and store the result in `temp`.
    b. Perform a bitwise AND (&) operation on `a` and `b`, and store the result in `a`.
    c. Shift `temp` left by one bit.
  3. Return `a`.
```

**Approach**

The approach for this problem is to use the XOR and AND operators to perform the addition of two integers without using the '+' operator. The XOR operator is used to find the bits that are different in two numbers, while the AND operator is used to find the bits that are the same in two numbers.

**C++ Code**

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int getSum(int a, int b) {
        while (b != 0) {
            int temp = (a & b) << 1;
            a = a ^ b;
            b = temp;
        }
        return a;
    }
};
```
