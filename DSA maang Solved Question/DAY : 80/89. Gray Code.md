# [89. Gray Code](https://leetcode.com/problems/gray-code/)

An n-bit gray code sequence is a sequence of 2n integers where:

- Every integer is in the inclusive range `[0, 2^n - 1[0, 2^n - 1]]`,
- The first integer is `0`,
- An integer appears no more than once in the sequence,
- The binary representation of every pair of adjacent integers differs by exactly one bit, and
- The binary representation of the first and last integers differs by exactly one bit.

Given an integer `n`, return any valid n-bit gray code sequence.

**Example 1:**

>**Input:** n = 2<br>
**Output:** [0,1,3,2]<br>
**Explanation:**<br>
>The binary representation of [0,1,3,2] is [00,01,11,10].<br>
>- 00 and 01 differ by one bit<br>
>- 01 and 11 differ by one bit<br>
>- 11 and 10 differ by one bit<br>
>- 10 and 00 differ by one bit<br>
>[0,2,3,1] is also a valid gray code sequence, whose binary representation is [00,10,11,01].<br>
>- 00 and 10 differ by one bit<br>
>- 10 and 11 differ by one bit<br>
>- 11 and 01 differ by one bit<br>
>- 01 and 00 differ by one bit

**Example 2:**

>**Input:** n = 1<br>
**Output:** [0,1]
 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= n <= 16`

# Solution
Sure, here is an algorithm and approach for generating the Gray code sequence, along with the corresponding C++ code:

**Algorithm:**

1. Initialize an empty vector `ans` to store the Gray code sequence.
2. Set the size of `ans` to `2^n`, where `n` is the number of bits in the Gray code sequence.
3. Iterate over the values of `i` from 0 to `(2^n)-1`.
4. For each value of `i`, calculate `i^(i>>1)` using the bitwise XOR (^) and right shift (>>) operators.
5. Store the calculated value in the `ans` vector at index `i`.
6. Return the `ans` vector.

**Approach:**

The Gray code sequence is a binary code in which adjacent codes differ in only one bit. This makes it useful for applications where it is important to minimize the number of bit transitions, such as digital-to-analog converters (DACs) and code division multiple access (CDMA) communication systems.

The algorithm for generating the Gray code sequence is based on the following property:

```
Gray(i) = i ^ (i >> 1)
```

where `i` is the index of the Gray code sequence. This property can be proven using induction.

**C++ Code:**

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> grayCode(int n) {
        // 1<<n gives us left shift of 1 by n, which is basically 2 to the power n
        vector<int> ans(1<<n);

        for (int i=0; i<(1<<n); i++) 
            // i >> 1 gives us right shift of i by 1, which is basically i/2
            ans[i] = i^(i>>1);
        return ans;
    }
};
```

This code implements the algorithm described above. It first initializes an empty vector `ans` to store the Gray code sequence. The size of `ans` is set to `2^n`, where `n` is the number of bits in the Gray code sequence.

The code then iterates over the values of `i` from 0 to `(2^n)-1`. For each value of `i`, it calculates `i^(i>>1)` using the bitwise XOR (^) and right shift (>>) operators. The calculated value is then stored in the `ans` vector at index `i`. Finally, the code returns the `ans` vector.
