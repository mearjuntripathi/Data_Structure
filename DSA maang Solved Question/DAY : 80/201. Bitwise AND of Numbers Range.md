# [201. Bitwise AND of Numbers Range](https://leetcode.com/problems/bitwise-and-of-numbers-range/)

Given two integers `left` and `right` that represent the range `[left, right]`, return the bitwise AND of all numbers in this range, inclusive.

**Example 1:**

>**Input:** left = 5, right = 7<br>
**Output:** 4

**Example 2:**

>**Input:** left = 0, right = 0<br>
**Output:** 0

**Example 3:**

>**Input:** left = 1, right = 2147483647<br>
**Output:** 0
 

**Constraints:**

- `0 <= left <= right <= 2^31 - 1`

# Solution
Sure, here is the algorithm, approach, and code in C++ for the `rangeBitwiseAnd` function:

**Algorithm**

1. Check if `left` is equal to 0. If it is, return 0.
2. Initialize a variable `moved` to 0.
3. While `left` is not equal to `right`, perform the following steps:
    a. Shift `left` one bit to the right.
    b. Shift `right` one bit to the right.
    c. Increment `moved` by 1.
4. Shift `left` to the left by `moved` bits.
5. Return the shifted value of `left`.

**Approach**

The `rangeBitwiseAnd` function takes two integers, `left` and `right`, as input and returns the bitwise AND of all the integers between `left` and `right`, inclusive. The function works by shifting both `left` and `right` to the right until they are equal. The number of bits that `left` and `right` are shifted to the right is stored in the variable `moved`. Finally, `left` is shifted to the left by `moved` bits to get the resulting bitwise AND.

**Code**

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int rangeBitwiseAnd(int left, int right) {
        if(left == 0) return 0;
        int moved = 0;
        while(left != right) {
            left >>= 1;
            right >>= 1;
            moved++;
        }
        return left <<= moved;
    }
};
```

**Example Usage**

```c++
Solution solution;
int result = solution.rangeBitwiseAnd(5, 7);
cout << result << endl; // Output: 4
```
