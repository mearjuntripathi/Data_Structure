# [542. 01 Matrix](https://leetcode.com/problems/01-matrix/)

Given an `m x n` binary matrix mat, return the distance of the nearest `0` for each cell.

The distance between two adjacent cells is `1`.

>**Input:** mat = [[0,0,0],[0,1,0],[0,0,0]]<br>
**Output:** [[0,0,0],[0,1,0],[0,0,0]]

>**Input:** mat = [[0,0,0],[0,1,0],[1,1,1]]<br>
**Output:** [[0,0,0],[0,1,0],[1,2,1]]
 

**Constraints:**

- `m == mat.length`
- `n == mat[i].length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 1e4`
- `1 <= m * n <= 1e4`
- `mat[i][j]` is either `0` or `1`.
- There is at least one `0` in `mat`.

# Solution

The approach for this solution is to use a queue to perform a breadth-first search on the matrix. We start by adding all of the cells with a value of 0 to the queue. These cells represent the starting points for our search. We then iterate over the queue, and for each cell in the queue, we check its four neighbors. If a neighbor has a value of -1, we update it to the current length of the search and add it to the queue. We continue this process until the queue is empty.

The algorithm for this solution is as follows:

1. Initialize a queue and add all of the cells with a value of 0 to the queue.
2. Set the length of the search to 0.
3. While the queue is not empty:
    * Remove the first cell from the queue.
    * For each of the four neighbors of the cell:
        * If the neighbor has a value of -1:
            * Update the neighbor to the current length of the search.
            * Add the neighbor to the queue.
    * Increment the length of the search.
4. Return the matrix.

Here is a C++ implementation of this algorithm:

```c++
class Solution {

public:
    vector<vector<int>> updateMatrix(vector<vector<int>>& mat) {
        queue<pair<int,int>>q;
        for(int i=0;i<mat.size();i++){
            for(int j=0;j<mat[0].size();j++){
                if(mat[i][j]==0)
                    q.push({i,j});
                else
                    mat[i][j]=-1;
            }
        }
        int length=0;
        int dirx[]={1,-1,0,0};
        int diry[]={0,0,1,-1};
        while(!q.empty()){
            int size=q.size();
            length++;
           while(size--){
               auto f=q.front();
               q.pop();
               int s=f.first;
               int end=f.second;
               for(int i=0;i<4;i++){
                   int r=s+dirx[i];
                   int c=end+diry[i];
                   if(r<0 || c<0 || r==mat.size() || c==mat[0].size() || mat[r][c]!=-1)
                      continue;
                   mat[r][c]=length;
                   q.push({r,c});
               }
           }
        }
        return mat;
    }
};
```

This algorithm is efficient because it only visits each cell in the matrix once. It also uses a queue to ensure that we visit the cells in the shortest possible distance from the starting points.
