# [994. Rotting Oranges](https://leetcode.com/problems/rotting-oranges/)

You are given an `m x n` `grid` where each cell can have one of three values:

- `0` representing an empty cell,
- `1` representing a fresh orange, or
- `2` representing a rotten orange.

Every minute, any fresh orange that is 4-directionally adjacent to a rotten orange becomes rotten.

Return the minimum number of minutes that must elapse until no cell has a fresh orange. If this is impossible, return `-1`.


**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/02/16/oranges.png)

>**Input:** grid = [[2,1,1],[1,1,0],[0,1,1]]<br>
**Output:** 4

**Example 2:**

>**Input:** grid = [[2,1,1],[0,1,1],[1,0,1]]<br>
**Output:** -1<br>
**Explanation:** The orange in the bottom left corner (row 2, column 0) is never rotten, because rotting only happens 4-directionally.

**Example 3:**

>**Input:** grid = [[0,2]]<br>
**Output:** 0<br>
**Explanation:** Since there are already no fresh oranges at minute 0, the answer is just 0.
 

**Constraints:**

- `m == grid.length`
- `n == grid[i].length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 10`
- `grid[i][j]` is `0`, `1`, or `2`.

# Solution

The approach to the solution is to use a queue to store the rotting oranges. We start by adding all the rotting oranges to the queue. Then, we iterate over the queue and check the four adjacent oranges of each rotting orange. If any of the adjacent oranges are fresh, we add them to the queue and mark them as rotten. We also decrement the count of fresh oranges. We repeat this process until the queue is empty or all the oranges have rotted.

The algorithm is as follows:

1. Initialize a queue to store the rotting oranges.
2. Initialize a count of fresh oranges.
3. Iterate over the grid and add all the rotting oranges to the queue.
4. While the queue is not empty:
    a. Get the front element of the queue and remove it.
    b. Check the four adjacent oranges of the rotting orange.
    c. If any of the adjacent oranges are fresh, add them to the queue and mark them as rotten.
    d. Decrement the count of fresh oranges.
5. If the count of fresh oranges is greater than zero, return -1.
6. Else, return the number of minutes it took for all the oranges to rot.

Here is a C++ implementation of the algorithm:

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int orangesRotting(vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
        int row = grid.size();
        int col = grid[0].size();

        queue<pair<int,int>> que;

        int fresh = 0;

        for(int i = 0 ; i < row ; i++){
            for(int j = 0 ; j < col ; j++){
                if(grid[i][j] == 2){
                    que.push({i,j});
                }else if(grid[i][j] == 1){
                    fresh++;
                }
            }
        }
                
        int minutes = 0;
        while(!que.empty()){
            int length = que.size();
            for(int i = 0 ; i < length ; i++){
                int r = que.front().first;
                int c = que.front().second;
                que.pop();
                // top
                if(c > 0 && grid[r][c-1] == 1){
                    fresh--;
                    grid[r][c-1] = 2;
                    que.push({r,c-1});
                }
                // right
                if(r < row-1 && grid[r+1][c] == 1){
                    fresh--;
                    grid[r+1][c] = 2;
                    que.push({r+1, c});
                }
                //bottom
                if(c < col-1 && grid[r][c+1] == 1){
                    fresh--;
                    grid[r][c+1] = 2;
                    que.push({r,c+1});
                }
                //left
                if(r > 0 && grid[r-1][c] == 1){
                    fresh--;
                    grid[r-1][c] = 2;
                    que.push({r-1,c});
                }
            }
            minutes++;
        }

        if(fresh) return -1;

        return minutes-1 < 0 ? 0 : minutes-1;
    }
};
