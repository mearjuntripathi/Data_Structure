## [200. Number of Islands](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-islands/)

Given an `m x n` 2D binary grid grid which represents a map of `'1'`s (land) and `'0'`s (water), return the number of islands.

An **island** is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.

**Example 1:**

>**Input:** grid = [<br>
  ["1","1","1","1","0"],<br>
  ["1","1","0","1","0"],<br>
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],<br>
  ["0","0","0","0","0"]<br>
]<br>
**Output:** 1

**Example 2:**

>**Input:** grid = [<br>
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],<br>
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],<br>
  ["0","0","1","0","0"],<br>
  ["0","0","0","1","1"]<br>
]<br>
**Output:** 3
 

**Constraints:**

- `m == grid.length`
- `n == grid[i].length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 300`
- `grid[i][j]` is `'0'` or `'1'`.

# Solution

The approach of this solution is to use a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm to find all of the connected components in the grid. A connected component is a group of cells that are all connected to each other, either directly or indirectly. An island is a connected component that is surrounded by water on all sides.

The DFS algorithm works by recursively exploring all of the cells in the grid that are connected to a given cell. To do this, the algorithm keeps track of a stack of cells to be visited. The algorithm starts by pushing the given cell onto the stack. Then, it pops the top cell off the stack and visits it. If the cell has any unvisited neighbors, the algorithm pushes them onto the stack. The algorithm continues this process until the stack is empty.

In this solution, the DFS algorithm is used to find all of the connected components in the grid that contain a cell with the value `1`. These connected components are the islands.

The algorithm works as follows:

1. Initialize a variable `island` to keep track of the number of islands found.
2. Initialize a variable `row` to store the number of rows in the grid.
3. Initialize a variable `col` to store the number of columns in the grid.
4. Iterate over the rows of the grid:
    * For each row, iterate over the columns of the grid:
        * If the cell at the current row and column has the value `1`:
            * Increment the `island` variable.
            * Call the DFS algorithm on the current cell.
5. Return the value of the `island` variable.

Here is a more detailed explanation of the DFS algorithm:

```c++
void dfs(vector<vector<char>> &grid, int i, int j) {
  // Check if the cell is out of bounds.
  if (i < 0 || i >= row || j < 0 || j >= col) {
    return;
  }

  // Check if the cell has already been visited.
  if (grid[i][j] == '0') {
    return;
  }

  // Mark the cell as visited.
  grid[i][j] = '0';

  // Recursively explore the neighboring cells.
  dfs(grid, i - 1, j);
  dfs(grid, i, j - 1);
  dfs(grid, i + 1, j);
  dfs(grid, i, j + 1);
}
```

This DFS algorithm will recursively explore all of the cells in the grid that are connected to the given cell. It will mark all of the visited cells as `0` to prevent them from being visited again.

The following is a complete example of the C++ solution:

```c++
class Solution {
public:
  int numIslands(vector<vector<char>>& grid) {
    int island = 0;
    row = grid.size();
    col = grid[0].size();
    for (int i = 0; i < row; i++) {
      for (int j = 0; j < col; j++) {
        if (grid[i][j] == '1') {
          dfs(grid, i, j);
          island++;
        }
      }
    }
    return island;
  }

private:
  int row, col;
  void dfs(vector<vector<char>>& grid, int i, int j) {
    if (i < 0 || i >= row || j < 0 || j >= col) {
      return;
    }

    if (grid[i][j] == '0') {
      return;
    }

    grid[i][j] = '0';

    dfs(grid, i - 1, j);
    dfs(grid, i, j - 1);
    dfs(grid, i + 1, j);
    dfs(grid, i, j + 1);
  }
};
```
