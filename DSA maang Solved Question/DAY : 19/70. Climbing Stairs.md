# [70. Climbing Stairs](https://leetcode.com/problems/climbing-stairs/)

You are climbing a staircase. It takes n steps to reach the top.

Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

 


**Example 1:**

>**Input:** n = 2<br>
**Output:** 2<br>
**Explanation:** There are two ways to climb to the top.
> 1. 1 step + 1 step
> 2. 2 steps

**Example 2:**

>**Input:** n = 3<br>
**Output:** 3<br>
**Explanation:** There are three ways to climb to the top.
> 1. 1 step + 1 step + 1 step
> 2. 1 step + 2 steps
> 3. 2 steps + 1 step
 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= n <= 45`

# Solution

The code I provided implements two approaches to the climbing stairs problem:

**Approach 1: Dynamic Programming**

This approach uses a memoization table to store the number of ways to climb the stairs up to each step. The algorithm works as follows:

1. Initialize a memoization table `dp` such that `dp[i]` represents the number of ways to climb the stairs up to step `i`.
2. Recursively compute the number of ways to climb the stairs up to each step, using the following formula:

```
dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2]
```

```cpp
class Solution {
    int helper(vector<int> &dp, int n){
        if(n <= 1)
            return 1;
        
        if(dp[n] != -1)
            return dp[n];
        
        return dp[n] = helper(dp,n-1) + helper(dp,n-2);
    }
public:
    int climbStairs(int n) {
        if(n <= 1) return 1;

        vector<int> dp(n,-1);

        return helper(dp,n-1) + helper(dp,n-2);
    }
};
```

This formula states that the number of ways to climb the stairs up to step `i` is equal to the number of ways to climb the stairs up to step `i - 1` plus the number of ways to climb the stairs up to step `i - 2`.
3. The number of ways to climb the stairs up to the top step is `dp[n - 1]`, where `n` is the total number of stairs.

**Approach 2: Fibonacci Sequence**

This approach uses the fact that the number of ways to climb the stairs up to a given step is equal to the Fibonacci number for that step.

The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is equal to the sum of the two previous numbers. The first two numbers in the sequence are 1 and 1.

The following algorithm computes the number of ways to climb the stairs up to a given step using the Fibonacci sequence:

1. Initialize two variables `a` and `b` to 1.
2. For each step `i` from 2 to `n`:
    * Set `a` to `a + b`.
    * Set `b` to `a - b`.
3. The number of ways to climb the stairs up to the top step is `a`.

```cpp
class Solution {
    int helper(vector<int> &dp, int n){
        if(n <= 1)
            return 1;
        
        if(dp[n] != -1)
            return dp[n];
        
        return dp[n] = helper(dp,n-1) + helper(dp,n-2);
    }
public:
    int climbStairs(int n) {
        if(n <= 1) return 1;

        int a = 1, b = 1;
        for(int i = 2 ; i <= n ; i ++){
            a = a+b;
            b = a-b;
        }
        return a;
    }
};
```

**Conclusion**

Both approaches to the climbing stairs problem are correct and efficient. The dynamic programming approach is more general and can be used to solve other problems that involve memoization. The Fibonacci sequence approach is more specific to the climbing stairs problem and is more efficient for this problem.
