# [509. Fibonacci Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/fibonacci-number/)

The **Fibonacci numbers**, commonly denoted `F(n)` form a sequence, called the Fibonacci sequence, such that each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from `0` and `1`. That is,

> F(0) = 0, F(1) = 1<br>
F(n) = F(n - 1) + F(n - 2), for n > 1.

Given `n`, calculate `F(n)`.

**Example 1:**

> **Input:** n = 2<br>
**Output:** 1<br>
**Explanation:** F(2) = F(1) + F(0) = 1 + 0 = 1.

**Example 2:**

> **Input:** n = 3<br>
**Output:** 2<br>
**Explanation:** F(3) = F(2) + F(1) = 1 + 1 = 2.

**Example 3:**

> **Input:** n = 4<br>
**Output:** 3<br>
**Explanation:** F(4) = F(3) + F(2) = 2 + 1 = 3.
 

**Constraints:**
- `0 <= n <= 30`

# Solution

The code I have provided implements three different approaches to the Fibonacci sequence problem: recursion, iteration, and dynamic programming.

**Recursive approach**

The recursive approach is the most straightforward way to solve the Fibonacci sequence problem. It works by recursively calling itself to calculate the Fibonacci numbers of smaller and smaller problems, until it reaches the base cases of `fib(0) = 0` and `fib(1) = 1`.

Here is a step-by-step explanation of the recursive approach:

1. If `n == 1`, then return 1.
2. If `n == 0`, then return 0.
3. Otherwise, return `fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2)`.

```cpp
class Solution {
    
public:
    int fib(int n) {
        // Recurtion method
        if(n == 1)
            return 1;
        if(n == 0)
            return 0;
        return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2);
    }
};
```

**Iterative approach**

The iterative approach works by maintaining two variables, `a` and `b`, which represent the previous two Fibonacci numbers. At each step, the sum of `a` and `b` is assigned to `a`, and the difference of `a` and `b` is assigned to `b`. This process is repeated until the desired Fibonacci number is reached.

Here is a step-by-step explanation of the iterative approach:

1. Initialize `a` to 0 and `b` to 1.
2. Repeat the following steps until `i == n`:
    * Set `a` to `a + b`.
    * Set `b` to `a - b`.
3. Return `a`.

```cpp
class Solution {

public:
    int fib(int n) {
       
        // Iterative method 
        int a = 0, b = 1;
        for(int i = 0 ; i < n ; i ++){
            a = a+b;
            b = a-b;
        }
        return a;
    }
};
```

**Dynamic programming approach**

The dynamic programming approach works by storing the precomputed Fibonacci numbers in a table. When asked to calculate the Fibonacci number of `n`, the algorithm simply looks up the corresponding value in the table. If the value is not already in the table, the algorithm calculates it recursively and stores it in the table for future use.

Here is a step-by-step explanation of the dynamic programming approach:

1. Initialize a table `dp` of size `n + 1` and set all values to -1.
2. Set `dp[0] = 0` and `dp[1] = 1`.
3. For each integer `i` from 2 to `n`:
    * If `dp[i] == -1`:
        * Calculate `dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2]` recursively.
    * Return `dp[i]`.

```cpp
class Solution {
    int helper(vector<int> &dp, int n){
        if(dp[n] != -1)
            return dp[n];
        return dp[n] = helper(dp,n-1) + helper(dp, n-2);
    }
public:
    int fib(int n) {
        // Dynamic approach
        if(n<=1) return n;
        vector<int> dp(n+1,-1);
        dp[0] = 0; dp[1] = 1;
        return helper(dp,n);
        
    }
};
```

**Which approach is best?**

The best approach to use depends on the specific requirements of the problem. The recursive approach is the simplest to understand and implement, but it is also the slowest. The iterative approach is faster than the recursive approach, but it is more complex to implement. The dynamic programming approach is the fastest of the three approaches, but it is also the most complex to implement.

In general, the dynamic programming approach is the best approach to use for large arrays, since it is the most efficient. However, the iterative approach may be a better choice for small arrays, since it is simpler to implement.
