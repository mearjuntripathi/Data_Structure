# [605. Can Place Flowers](https://leetcode.com/problems/can-place-flowers/)

You have a long flowerbed in which some of the plots are planted, and some are not. However, flowers cannot be planted in adjacent plots.

Given an integer array `flowerbed` containing `0`'s and `1`'s, where `0` means empty and `1` means not empty, and an integer `n`, return `true` if n new flowers can be planted in the `flowerbed` without violating the no-adjacent-flowers rule and `false` otherwise.


**Example 1:**

> **Input:** flowerbed = [1,0,0,0,1], n = 1<br>
**Output:** true

**Example 2:**

> **Input:** flowerbed = [1,0,0,0,1], n = 2<br>
**Output:** false
 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= flowerbed.length <= 2 * 104`
- `flowerbed[i]` is `0` or `1`.
- There are no two adjacent flowers in `flowerbed`.
- `0 <= n <= flowerbed.length`

# Solution

The approach used in the code you provided is to iterate over the `flowerbed` array and check each position to see if it is empty and if its adjacent positions are also empty. If all three conditions are met, then a flower can be planted at that position. The algorithm terminates when all flowers have been planted or when the end of the array is reached.

Here is a more detailed explanation of the algorithm:

1. Initialize a counter `n` to the number of flowers to be planted.
2. Iterate over the `flowerbed` array:
    * If the current position is empty and its adjacent positions are also empty, then plant a flower at that position and decrement `n`.
3. If `n` is zero, then return `true`. Otherwise, return `false`.

Here is a step-by-step example of how the algorithm works:


Input: flowerbed = [0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0], n = 2

1. n = 2
2. Iterate over the flowerbed array:
    * Position 0: The current position is empty and its adjacent positions are also empty, so plant a flower at that position. n = 1.
    * Position 1: The current position is not empty, so skip it.
    * Position 2: The current position is empty and its adjacent positions are also empty, so plant a flower at that position. n = 0.
3. Since n is zero, return true.


The time complexity of the algorithm is O(n), where `n` is the size of the `flowerbed` array. This is because the algorithm iterates over the array exactly once. The space complexity of the algorithm is O(1), since it only requires a single counter variable.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool canPlaceFlowers(vector<int>& flowerbed, int n) {
        for(int i = 0 ; i < flowerbed.size() && n ; i++){
            if(!flowerbed[i]){
                bool left = (i == 0 || flowerbed[i-1] == 0);
                bool right = (i == flowerbed.size()-1 || flowerbed[i+1] == 0);

                if(left && right){
                    flowerbed[i] = 1;
                    n--;
                }
            }
        }
        return n == 0;
    }
};
```

## Pros and Cons of the Greedy Approach

The following are the pros and cons of the greedy approach used in the code you provided:

**Pros:**

* Simple to understand and implement.
* Efficient in terms of time and space complexity.

**Cons:**

* Not guaranteed to find the optimal solution.

## Conclusion

The greedy approach is a simple and efficient way to solve the problem of placing flowers in a flowerbed. It is not guaranteed to find the optimal solution, but it is a good heuristic for most cases.
