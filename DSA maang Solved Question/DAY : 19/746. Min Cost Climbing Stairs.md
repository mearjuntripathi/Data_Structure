# [746. Min Cost Climbing Stairs](https://leetcode.com/problems/min-cost-climbing-stairs/)

You are given an integer array cost where cost[i] is the cost of ith step on a staircase. Once you pay the cost, you can either climb one or two steps.

You can either start from the step with index 0, or the step with index 1.

Return the minimum cost to reach the top of the floor.

 


**Example 1:**

> **Input:** cost = [10,15,20]<br>
**Output:** 15<br>
**Explanation:** You will start at index 1.
>- Pay 15 and climb two steps to reach the top.
>The total cost is 15.

**Example 2:**

> **Input:** cost = [1,100,1,1,1,100,1,1,100,1]<br>
**Output:** 6<br>
**Explanation:** You will start at index 0.
>- Pay 1 and climb two steps to reach index 2.
>- Pay 1 and climb two steps to reach index 4.
>- Pay 1 and climb two steps to reach index 6.
>- Pay 1 and climb one step to reach index 7.
>- Pay 1 and climb two steps to reach index 9.
>- Pay 1 and climb one step to reach the top.
>The total cost is 6.
 

**Constraints:**

- `2 <= cost.length <= 1000`
- `0 <= cost[i] <= 999`

# Solution

The code I provided has two approaches to solving the problem of finding the minimum cost to climb a staircase with a given cost for each step:

**Approach 1**

This approach uses a dynamic programming (DP) technique. The main idea is to create a DP table `dp` to store the minimum cost to climb up to each step. The table is initialized such that `dp[0]` and `dp[1]` are equal to the cost of the first and second steps, respectively. All other entries in the table are initialized to `-1`.

The `helper()` function recursively computes the minimum cost to climb up to a given step `n`, using the `dp` table to store the results. The function works as follows:

1. If `n <= 1`, then the minimum cost to climb up to step `n` is simply the cost of step `n`.
2. If the entry `dp[n]` is already computed, then the function simply returns the value of `dp[n]`.
3. Otherwise, the function computes the minimum cost to climb up to step `n` as follows:

    ```
    dp[n] = min(helper(dp,n-1,cost),helper(dp,n-2,cost))+cost[n];
    ```

    This means that the minimum cost to climb up to step `n` is the minimum of the following two costs:

    * The cost to climb up to step `n-1` plus the cost of step `n`.
    * The cost to climb up to step `n-2` plus the cost of step `n`.
```cpp
class Solution {
    int helper(vector<int> &dp, int n, vector<int> &cost){
        if(n <= 1)
            return cost[n];

        if(dp[n] != -1)
            return dp[n];

        return dp[n] = min(helper(dp,n-1,cost),helper(dp,n-2,cost))+cost[n];
    }
public:
    int minCostClimbingStairs(vector<int>& cost) {
        int n = cost.size();
        vector<int> dp(n,-1);
        return min(helper(dp,n-1,cost), helper(dp,n-2,cost));
    }
};
```

The `minCostClimbingStairs()` function simply calls the `helper()` function to compute the minimum cost to climb up to the last step of the staircase. It then returns the minimum of this cost and the cost to climb to the next-to-last step.

**Approach 2**

This approach is a bottom-up approach to solving the problem. It works by iteratively computing the minimum cost to climb up to each step of the staircase, starting from the bottom.

The main idea is to keep track of the minimum cost to climb up to the previous two steps. The minimum cost to climb up to the current step is then computed by adding the cost of the current step to the minimum of the previous two costs.

```cpp
class Solution {
    int helper(vector<int> &dp, int n, vector<int> &cost){
        if(n <= 1)
            return cost[n];

        if(dp[n] != -1)
            return dp[n];

        return dp[n] = min(helper(dp,n-1,cost),helper(dp,n-2,cost))+cost[n];
    }
public:
    int minCostClimbingStairs(vector<int>& cost) {
        int n = cost.size();
        
        for(int i = 2 ; i < n ; i++)
            cost[i] += min(cost[i-1],cost[i-2]);
        
        return min(cost[n-1], cost[n-2]);
    }
};
```

The `minCostClimbingStairs()` function simply iterates over the steps of the staircase, computing the minimum cost to climb up to each step as described above. It then returns the minimum of the minimum costs to climb up to the last and next-to-last steps.

**Complexity Analysis**

Both approaches have a time complexity of O(n), where `n` is the number of steps in the staircase. This is because both approaches need to iterate over all of the steps in the staircase.

The space complexity of the first approach is O(n), since it uses a DP table to store the results. The space complexity of the second approach is O(1), since it only needs to keep track of the minimum costs to climb up to the previous two steps.

**Conclusion**

Both approaches to solving the problem of finding the minimum cost to climb a staircase with a given cost for each step are correct and efficient. The first approach is a more general DP technique, while the second approach is a more specialized approach that is tailored to this specific problem.

Which approach you choose to use may depend on your preferences and the specific context in which you are using the code. For example, if you need to solve a more general problem that involves computing the minimum cost to reach a certain state, then you may want to use the first approach. If you are only interested in solving the specific problem of finding the minimum cost to climb a staircase, then you may want to use the second approach, since it is more efficient in terms of space complexity.
