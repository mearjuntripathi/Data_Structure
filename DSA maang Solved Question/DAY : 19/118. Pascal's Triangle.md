# [118. Pascal's Triangle](https://leetcode.com/problems/pascals-triangle/)

Given an integer `numRows`, return the first numRows of Pascal's triangle.

In **Pascal's triangle**, each number is the sum of the two numbers directly above it as shown:

# Solution

The approach of the given code is to generate Pascal's triangle using a dynamic programming algorithm. Pascal's triangle is a triangular array of the binomial coefficients, where each entry is the sum of the two entries above it.

The algorithm works as follows:

1. Initialize a 2D vector `pascal` to store the Pascal's triangle.
2. For each row `i` in Pascal's triangle:
    * Resize the `pascal[i]` row to have `i + 1` elements, all initialized to 1.
    * For each element `j` in the `pascal[i]` row, starting from `j = 1` to `j = i - 1`:
        * Set the element `pascal[i][j]` to the sum of the two elements above it, `pascal[i - 1][j - 1]` and `pascal[i - 1][j]`.
3. Return the `pascal` vector.

Here is a step-by-step example of how the algorithm works:


Input: numRows = 5

1. Initialize the `pascal` vector:

    pascal = [[1], [1, 1], [1, 2, 1], [1, 3, 3, 1], [1, 4, 6, 4, 1]]

2. Generate Pascal's triangle:

    For each row `i` in Pascal's triangle:
        * Resize the `pascal[i]` row to have `i + 1` elements, all initialized to 1.
        * For each element `j` in the `pascal[i]` row, starting from `j = 1` to `j = i - 1`:
            * Set the element `pascal[i][j]` to the sum of the two elements above it, `pascal[i - 1][j - 1]` and `pascal[i - 1][j]`.

3. Return the `pascal` vector.

```cpp
vector<vector<int>> generate(int numRows) {
    vector<vector<int>> pascal(numRows);
    
    for(int i = 0 ; i < numRows ; i++){
        pascal[i].resize(i+1, 1);
        for(int j = 1 ; j < i ; j++)
            pascal[i][j] = pascal[i-1][j-1] + pascal[i-1][j];
    }
    return pascal;
}
```

The time complexity of the algorithm is O(n^2), where `n` is the number of rows in Pascal's triangle. This is because the algorithm needs to visit each element in the Pascal's triangle once. The space complexity of the algorithm is also O(n^2), since the `pascal` vector needs to store the entire Pascal's triangle.

## Conclusion

The dynamic programming approach is a simple and efficient way to generate Pascal's triangle. It has a time complexity of O(n^2) and a space complexity of O(n^2).
