# [516. Longest Palindromic Subsequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-palindromic-subsequence/)

Given a string `s`, find the longest palindromic subsequence's length in `s`.

A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

**Example 1:**

>**Input:** s = "bbbab"<br>
**Output:** 4<br>
**Explanation:** One possible longest palindromic subsequence is "bbbb".

**Example 2:**

>**Input:** s = "cbbd"<br>
**Output:** 2<br>
**Explanation:** One possible longest palindromic subsequence is "bb".

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= s.length <= 1000`
- `s` consists only of lowercase English letters.

# Solution
The provided C++ code implements the dynamic programming approach to solve the Longest Palindromic Subsequence (LPS) problem. The algorithm utilizes a bottom-up approach, gradually building up the solution from smaller subproblems to the entire sequence. It employs two vectors, `curr` and `next`, to store intermediate results.

**Approach:**

1. **Reverse the input string:** Since the longest palindromic subsequence of a string is also the longest palindromic subsequence of its reverse, we can reverse the input string to simplify the calculations.

2. **Initialize two vectors:** Create two vectors, `curr` and `next`, of size `n+1`, where `n` is the length of the input string. These vectors will store the lengths of the longest palindromic subsequences for the prefixes of the input string.

3. **Fill the vectors:** Iterate through the input string from the last character to the first character. For each character `s[i]`, iterate through the reversed input string from the last character to the first character.

   a. **Matching characters:** If the current character `s[i]` matches the current character of the reversed string `rev[j]`, then the length of the longest palindromic subsequence for these two positions is 1 more than the length of the longest palindromic subsequence for the next characters in both strings.

   b. **Non-matching characters:** If the current character `s[i]` does not match the current character of the reversed string `rev[j]`, then the length of the longest palindromic subsequence for these two positions is the maximum of the lengths of the longest palindromic subsequences for the next character in `s` and the next character in `rev`, excluding the current characters.

   c. **Update `curr` vector:** After calculating the length of the longest palindromic subsequence for `s[i]` and `rev[j]`, store it in the `curr` vector at position `j`.

4. **Swap vectors:** After completing the iteration for the current row, swap the `curr` and `next` vectors. This ensures that the `curr` vector always contains the latest results.

5. **Return the final result:** The length of the longest palindromic subsequence for the entire input string is stored in the `next` vector at position 0. Return this value as the final result.

**Algorithm:**

```c++
int longestPalindromeSubseq(string s) {
  // Reverse the input string
  string rev = s;
  reverse(s.begin(), s.end());

  // Initialize two vectors
  vector<int> curr(s.size() + 1, 0);
  vector<int> next(rev.size() + 1, 0);

  // Fill the vectors
  for (int i = s.size() - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
    for (int j = rev.size() - 1; j >= 0; j--) {
      int ans;
      if (s[i] == rev[j]) {
        ans = 1 + next[j + 1];
      } else {
        ans = max(curr[j + 1], next[j]);
      }
      curr[j] = ans;
    }
    next = curr;
  }

  // Return the final result
  return next[0];
}
```

In summary, the provided C++ code efficiently solves the Longest Palindromic Subsequence problem using dynamic programming, achieving a time complexity of O(n^2), where `n` is the length of the input string.
