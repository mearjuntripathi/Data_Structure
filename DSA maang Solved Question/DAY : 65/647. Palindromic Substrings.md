# [647. Palindromic Substrings](https://leetcode.com/problems/palindromic-substrings/)

Given a string `s`, return the number of palindromic substrings in it.

A string is a palindrome when it reads the same backward as forward.

A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within the string.

**Example 1:**

>**Input:** s = "abc"<br>
**Output:** 3<br>
**Explanation:** Three palindromic strings: "a", "b", "c".

**Example 2:**

>**Input:** s = "aaa"<br>
**Output:** 6<br>
**Explanation:** Six palindromic strings: "a", "a", "a", "aa", "aa", "aaa".
 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= s.length <= 1000`
- `s` consists of lowercase English letters.

# Solution

Sure, here is an approach and algorithm for the solution in C++:

**Approach:**

The problem can be solved using a two-pointer approach. The idea is to iterate over the string and consider each character as the center of a palindrome. For each character, we expand outwards to the left and right to find the longest palindromic substring centered at that character. We also consider palindromes that are centered between two characters.

**Algorithm:**

1. Initialize a counter `count` to store the number of palindromic substrings.
2. Define a function `buildPalindrome(string &s, int left, int right)` that expands outwards from the center characters `left` and `right` to find the longest palindromic substring centered at that character. The function increments the `count` variable for each palindromic substring it finds.
3. Iterate over the string `s`, starting from index 0.
4. For each index `i`, call the `buildPalindrome` function to find the longest palindromic substrings centered at `i` and `i+1`.
5. Return the value of `count`.

Here is the C++ code for the solution:

```c++
class Solution {
  int count = 0;
  void buildPalindrome(string &s, int left, int right){
    while(left >= 0 && right < s.size() && s[left] == s[right]){
      count++;
      left--;
      right++;
    }
  }
public:
  int countSubstrings(string s) {
    for(int i = 0 ; i < s.size() ; i++){
      buildPalindrome(s,i,i);
      buildPalindrome(s,i,i+1);
    }
    return count;
  }
};
```

I hope this helps!
