# [698. Partition to K Equal Sum Subsets](https://leetcode.com/problems/partition-to-k-equal-sum-subsets/)

Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`, return true if it is possible to divide this array into k non-empty subsets whose sums are all equal.

**Example 1:**

>**Input:** nums = [4,3,2,3,5,2,1], k = 4<br>
**Output:** true<br>
**Explanation:** It is possible to divide it into 4 subsets (5), (1, 4), (2,3), (2,3) with equal sums.

**Example 2:**

>**Input:** nums = [1,2,3,4], k = 3<br>
**Output:** false
 

Constraints:

- `1 <= k <= nums.length <= 16`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= 1e4`
- The frequency of each element is in the range `[1, 4]`.

# Solution

Sure, here is an approach and algorithm for the solution in C++:

**Approach**

The problem of partitioning a set of integers into k subsets with equal sums can be solved using backtracking. Backtracking is an algorithm that explores all possible solutions to a problem by recursively trying different choices and backtracking when a choice leads to a dead end.

In this case, the backtracking algorithm will try different ways to divide the set of integers into k subsets. At each step, the algorithm will choose an integer to add to a subset. If the sum of the subset exceeds the target sum, the algorithm will backtrack and try a different choice. If all of the integers have been added to subsets and the sums of all the subsets are equal, then the algorithm has found a solution.

**Algorithm**

Here is the algorithm for the solution in C++:

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int len;
    vector<int> nums;
    vector<bool> st;

    bool dfs(int start, int cur, int k) {
        if (k==1) return true;
        if (cur == len) return dfs(0, 0, k - 1);
        for (int i = start; i < nums.size(); i ++ ) {
            if (st[i]) continue;
            if (cur + nums[i] <= len) {
                st[i] = true;
                if (dfs(i + 1, cur + nums[i], k)) return true;
                st[i] = false;
            }
            while (i + 1 < nums.size() && nums[i + 1] == nums[i]) i ++ ;
            if (!cur || cur + nums[i] == len) return false;
        }
        return false;
    }
    bool canPartitionKSubsets(vector<int>& _nums, int k) {
        nums = _nums;
        st.resize(nums.size());
        int sum = accumulate(nums.begin(), nums.end(), 0);
        if (sum % k) return false;
        len = sum / k;
        sort(nums.begin(), nums.end(), greater<int>());
        return dfs(0, 0, k);
    }
};
```

This algorithm first initializes some variables, including the target sum `len`, the set of integers `nums`, and a boolean vector `st` to keep track of which integers have been added to subsets. The algorithm then checks if the sum of the integers is divisible by k, and returns false if it is not. Otherwise, the algorithm sorts the integers in descending order and calls the `dfs` function to try to find a solution.

The `dfs` function takes three arguments: the start index of the integers to consider, the current sum of the subset, and the number of remaining subsets. The function first checks if there are any remaining subsets. If not, then the function has found a solution and returns true. Otherwise, the function loops through the integers starting at the start index. For each integer, the function checks if adding the integer to the current subset would exceed the target sum. If not, then the function adds the integer to the subset and calls the `dfs` function recursively. If the recursive call returns true, then the function has found a solution and returns true. Otherwise, the function removes the integer from the subset and marks it as not used. The function then continues looping through the integers. If the loop completes without finding a solution, then the function returns false.

I hope this helps!
