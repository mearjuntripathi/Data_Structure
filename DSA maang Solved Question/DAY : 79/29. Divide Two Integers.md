# [29. Divide Two Integers](https://leetcode.com/problems/divide-two-integers/)

Given two integers `dividend` and `divisor`, divide two integers without using multiplication, division, and mod operator.

The integer division should truncate toward zero, which means losing its fractional part. For example, `8.345` would be truncated to `8`, and `-2.7335` would be truncated to `-2`.

Return the quotient after dividing `dividend` by `divisor`.

Note: Assume we are dealing with an environment that could only store integers within the 32-bit signed integer range: `[−2^31, 2^31 − 1]`. For this problem, if the quotient is strictly greater than `2^31 - 1`, then return `2^31 - 1`, and if the quotient is strictly less than `-2^31`, then return `-2^31`.


**Example 1:**

>**Input:** dividend = 10, divisor = 3<br>
**Output:** 3<br>
**Explanation:** 10/3 = 3.33333.. which is truncated to 3.

**Example 2:**

>**Input:** dividend = 7, divisor = -3<br>
**Output:** -2<br>
**Explanation:** 7/-3 = -2.33333.. which is truncated to -2.
 

**Constraints:**

- `-2^31 <= dividend, divisor <= 2^31 - 1`
- `divisor != 0`

# Solution
Sure, here is an algorithm, approach, and code in C++ for dividing two long integers:

**Algorithm:**

1. Check if the signs of the dividend and divisor are the same. If they are, then the sign of the quotient will be positive; otherwise, it will be negative.
2. Make the dividend and divisor positive.
3. Initialize a counter to 0 and a variable to store the quotient.
4. Shift the divisor left by one bit until it is greater than or equal to the dividend.
5. Subtract the divisor from the dividend and add 1 to the quotient.
6. Repeat steps 4 and 5 until the counter is less than 0.
7. If the quotient is greater than the maximum value of an integer, then set it to the maximum value of an integer.
8. If the quotient is less than the minimum value of an integer, then set it to the minimum value of an integer.
9. Return the quotient.

**Approach:**

This algorithm uses a bit-shifting technique to divide two long integers. The algorithm works by repeatedly shifting the divisor left by one bit until it is greater than or equal to the dividend. The quotient is then incremented by 1, and the dividend is subtracted by the divisor. This process is repeated until the counter is less than 0.

**Code:**

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    long long divide(long long dividend, long long divisor) {
        long long count = 0, ans = 0;
        bool isNegative;
        if (dividend < 0 && divisor < 0) {
            isNegative = false;
            dividend = -dividend;
            divisor = -divisor;
        } else if (dividend < 0 || divisor < 0) {
            isNegative = true;
            dividend = abs(dividend);
            divisor = abs(divisor);
        } else {
            isNegative = false;
        }
        for (count; (divisor << count) <= dividend; ++count) {}
        while (count >= 0) {
            if (dividend >= (divisor << count)) {
                dividend -= (divisor << count);
                ans += 1LL << count;
            } else {
                --count;
            }
        }
        if (isNegative) ans = -ans;
        if (ans > INT_MAX) ans = INT_MAX;
        if (ans < INT_MIN) ans = INT_MIN;
        return ans;
    }
};
```

This code implements the algorithm described above. It first checks the signs of the dividend and divisor and then makes them positive. It then initializes a counter to 0 and a variable to store the quotient. The code then shifts the divisor left by one bit until it is greater than or equal to the dividend. The quotient is then incremented by 1, and the dividend is subtracted by the divisor. This process is repeated until the counter is less than 0. Finally, the code checks if the quotient is greater than or equal to the maximum value of an integer or less than or equal to the minimum value of an integer and sets it to the appropriate value. The code then returns the quotient.
