# [137. Single Number II](https://leetcode.com/problems/single-number-ii/)

Given an integer array `nums` where every element appears three times except for one, which appears exactly once. Find the single element and return it.

You must implement a solution with a linear runtime complexity and use only constant extra space.

**Example 1:**

>**Input:** nums = [2,2,3,2]<br>
**Output:** 3

**Example 2:**

>**Input:** nums = [0,1,0,1,0,1,99]<br>
**Output:** 99
 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 1e4`
- `-2^31 <= nums[i] <= 2^31 - 1`
- Each element in `nums` appears exactly three times except for one element which appears once.

# Solution

Sure, here is the algorithm, approach, and code in C++ for the problem of finding the single number in an array:

**Problem:**

Given an array of integers where every element appears twice except for one element, find that single element.

**Algorithm:**

The algorithm utilizes the bitwise XOR (^) operation to identify the single number. XOR is a binary operation that takes two bits and produces a single bit result. The result is 1 if the two bits are different, and 0 if they are the same.

**Approach:**

The approach is to perform XOR operations on all the elements in the array. Initially, two variables 'a' and 'b' are initialized to 0. Then, for each element 'num' in the array, perform the following steps:

1. Update 'a' using the XOR operation:
   a = (a ^ num) & ~b

2. Update 'b' using the XOR operation:
   b = (b ^ num) & ~a

The reason for using the AND (&) and NOT (~) operations in the XOR operations is to ensure that only the unique bits are preserved.

Finally, the value of 'a' will be the single number in the array.

**Code:**

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int singleNumber(vector<int>& nums) {
        int a = 0, b = 0;
        for(auto num : nums){
            a = (a ^ num) & ~b;
            b = (b ^ num) & ~a;
        }
        return a;
    }
};
```

**Explanation:**

The code implements the algorithm described above. It iterates through the array of integers and performs the XOR operations to calculate the single number. Finally, it returns the value of 'a', which is the single number.
