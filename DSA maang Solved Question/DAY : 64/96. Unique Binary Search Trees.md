# Solution

Sure, here is an approach and algorithm for the solution in C++:

**Approach:**

The approach used in this solution is to use dynamic programming to solve the Catalan numbers problem. Catalan numbers are a special type of number that counts the number of ways to triangulate an n-gon. In other words, they count the number of ways to divide an n-gon into non-overlapping triangles.

**Algorithm:**

The algorithm for this solution is as follows:

1. Initialize an array `dp` of size `n+1` to all -1.
2. Define a recursive function `helper(n)` that takes an integer `n` as input and returns the number of ways to triangulate an n-gon.
3. The base cases of the recursion are `n = 0`, `n = 1`, and `n = 2`. For these cases, the return value is 1, 1, and 2, respectively.
4. For all other values of `n`, the recursion is as follows:
   a. Initialize a variable `ans` to 0.
   b. For `i` from 1 to `n`, add `helper(i-1) * helper(n-i)` to `ans`.
   c. Return `ans`.
5. Call the `helper(n)` function with `n = n` to get the number of ways to triangulate an n-gon.

**Code:**

```c++
class Solution {
 public:
  int numTrees(int n) {
    vector<int> dp(20, -1);
    return helper(n);
  }

 private:
  int helper(int n) {
    if (n == 0 || n == 1) return 1;
    if (n == 2) return 2;
    if (dp[n] != -1) return dp[n];
    int ans = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) ans += helper(i - 1) * helper(n - i);
    return dp[n] = ans;
  }
};
```

**Complexity:**

The time complexity of this solution is O(n^2), where n is the number of nodes in the tree. The space complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree.
