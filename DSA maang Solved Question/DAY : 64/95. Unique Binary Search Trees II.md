# Solution

Sure, here is an approach and algorithm for the given solution in C++:

**Approach:**

The problem of generating all unique binary trees given the number of nodes (n) can be solved using a recursive approach. The idea is to generate all possible subtrees for each node and then combine them to form the complete binary tree.

**Algorithm:**

1. Define a function `generateTrees(low, high)` that takes two integer parameters, `low` and `high`, representing the range of nodes to consider for generating subtrees.

2. Create an empty vector `tree` to store the generated subtrees.

3. If `low` is greater than `high`, it means there are no more nodes to consider, so add `NULL` to the `tree` vector, indicating an empty subtree.

4. Iterate from `low` to `high`, representing the current node.

5. Generate all possible left subtrees using the `generateTrees(low, i-1)` function.

6. Generate all possible right subtrees using the `generateTrees(i+1, high)` function.

7. For each combination of a left subtree and a right subtree, create a new node with the current node's value and the subtrees as its left and right children, respectively.

8. Add the newly created node to the `tree` vector.

9. Return the `tree` vector containing all possible subtrees for the given range of nodes.

**C++ Implementation:**

```c++
class Solution {
    vector<TreeNode*> generateTrees(int low, int high){
        vector<TreeNode*> tree;
        if(low > high){
            tree.push_back(NULL);
            return tree;
        }
        for(int i = low ; i <= high ; i++){
            vector<TreeNode*> left = generateTrees(low, i-1);
            vector<TreeNode*> right = generateTrees(i+1, high);
            for(auto t1 : left)
                for(auto t2 : right){
                    TreeNode *root = new TreeNode(i, t1, t2);
                    tree.push_back(root);
                }
        }
        return tree;
    }
public:
    vector<TreeNode*> generateTrees(int n) {
        return generateTrees(1, n);
    }
};
```

This code defines a class `Solution` with two methods: `generateTrees(int low, int high)` and `generateTrees(int n)`. The `generateTrees(int low, int high)` method generates all possible subtrees for a given range of nodes, while the `generateTrees(int n)` method generates all possible unique binary trees with `n` nodes.
