# [494. Target Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/target-sum/)

You are given an integer array nums and an integer target.

You want to build an expression out of nums by adding one of the symbols `'+'` and `'-'` before each integer in nums and then concatenate all the integers.

- For example, if `nums = [2, 1]`, you can add a `'+'` before 2 and a `'-'` before 1 and concatenate them to build the expression `"+2-1"`.
Return the number of different expressions that you can build, which evaluates to target.

**Example 1:**

>**Input:** nums = [1,1,1,1,1], target = 3
**Output:** 5
**Explanation:** There are 5 ways to assign symbols to make the sum of nums be target 3.<br>
-1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 3<br>
+1 - 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 3<br>
+1 + 1 - 1 + 1 + 1 = 3<br>
+1 + 1 + 1 - 1 + 1 = 3<br>
+1 + 1 + 1 + 1 - 1 = 3

**Example 2:**

>**Input:** nums = [1], target = 1<br>
**Output:** 1 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 20`
- `0 <= nums[i] <= 1000`
- `0 <= sum(nums[i]) <= 1000`
- `-1000 <= target <= 1000`

# Solution
Sure, here is an approach and algorithm for the given solution in C++:

**Approach**

The given problem can be solved using the backtracking algorithm. The backtracking algorithm is a problem-solving technique that involves trying different choices and backtracking when they lead to dead ends. In this problem, the different choices are the values of the numbers in the nums vector. The backtracking occurs when the sum of the chosen numbers is greater than the target sum.

**Algorithm**

Here is the algorithm for the given problem in C++:

```c++
class Solution {
    int findTargetSumWays(vector<int> &nums, int target, int n, int i){
        if(i == n){
            if(target == 0)
                return 1;
            return 0;
        }
        int pos = findTargetSumWays(nums, target - nums[i], n, i+1);
        int neg = findTargetSumWays(nums, target + nums[i], n, i+1);
        return pos + neg;
    }
public:
    int findTargetSumWays(vector<int>& nums, int target) {
        return findTargetSumWays(nums, target, nums.size(), 0);
    }
};
```

This code defines a class `Solution` with a method `findTargetSumWays`. The `findTargetSumWays` method takes three arguments: a vector of integers `nums`, a target sum `target`, the size of the vector `n`, and the current index `i`.

The `findTargetSumWays` method first checks if the current index `i` is equal to the size of the vector `n`. If it is, then it checks if the target sum `target` is equal to 0. If it is, then it returns 1. Otherwise, it returns 0.

Otherwise, the `findTargetSumWays` method recursively calls itself twice. The first time, it calls itself with the target sum `target - nums[i]` and increments the current index `i` by 1. The second time, it calls itself with the target sum `target + nums[i]` and increments the current index `i` by 1.

The `findTargetSumWays` method then returns the sum of the two recursive calls.

**Time Complexity**

The time complexity of the given algorithm is O(2^n), where n is the size of the vector nums. This is because the algorithm makes at most 2^n recursive calls.

**Space Complexity**

The space complexity of the given algorithm is O(n), where n is the size of the vector nums. This is because the algorithm uses at most n stack frames.
