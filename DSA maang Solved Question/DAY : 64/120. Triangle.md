# [120. Triangle](https://leetcode.com/problems/triangle/)

Given a triangle array, return the minimum path sum from top to bottom.

For each step, you may move to an adjacent number of the row below. More formally, if you are on index i on the current row, you may move to either index i or index i + 1 on the next row.

**Example 1:**

>**Input:** triangle = [[2],[3,4],[6,5,7],[4,1,8,3]]<br>
**Output:** 11<br>
**Explanation:** The triangle looks like:<br>
   2<br>
  3 4<br>
 6 5 7<br>
4 1 8 3<br>
The minimum path sum from top to bottom is 2 + 3 + 5 + 1 = 11 (underlined above).

**Example 2:**

>**Input:** triangle = [[-10]]<br>
**Output:** -10
 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= triangle.length <= 200`
- `triangle[0].length == 1`
- `triangle[i].length == triangle[i - 1].length + 1`
- `-1e4 <= triangle[i][j] <= 1e4`

# Solution
Sure, here is an approach and algorithm for the given solution in C++:

**Approach:**

The problem can be solved using dynamic programming. The idea is to store the minimum sum of all paths from the top of the triangle to each cell in a 2D dp array. The dp array is initialized with the values of the triangle itself. Then, we iterate over the dp array in bottom-up order, filling in the minimum sum for each cell based on the minimum sums of its adjacent cells. Finally, the minimum sum for the top cell of the triangle is returned as the solution to the problem.

**Algorithm:**

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int minimumTotal(vector<vector<int>>& triangle) {
        int n = triangle.size();
        vector<vector<int>> dp = triangle;

        for(int i = 0; i < n-1 ; i++)
            for(int j = 0 ; j < dp[i].size(); j++)
                dp[i][j] = 0;
        
        for(int i = n-2 ;i >=0 ; i--)
            for(int j = 0 ; j < dp[i].size(); j++)
                dp[i][j] = min(dp[i+1][j],dp[i+1][j+1])+triangle[i][j]; 
            
        
        return dp[0][0] ;
    }
};
```

**Explanation:**

The first part of the code initializes the dp array with the values of the triangle itself. The nested for loops iterate over the dp array in row-major order, filling in the minimum sum for each cell based on the minimum sums of its adjacent cells. The second part of the code reverses the order of the nested for loops so that the dp array is filled in bottom-up order. Finally, the minimum sum for the top cell of the triangle is returned as the solution to the problem.

**Time complexity:**

The time complexity of the algorithm is O(n^2), where n is the number of rows in the triangle. This is because the algorithm iterates over each cell in the dp array exactly once.

**Space complexity:**

The space complexity of the algorithm is also O(n^2), where n is the number of rows in the triangle. This is because the dp array stores the minimum sum for each cell in the triangle.
