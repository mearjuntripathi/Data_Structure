# [58. Length of Last Word](https://leetcode.com/problems/length-of-last-word/)

Given a string `s` consisting of words and spaces, return the length of the last word in the string.

A **word** is a maximal 
<a title ="Substring
A substring is a contiguous non-empty sequence of characters within a string.">substring</a>
 consisting of non-space characters only.

 

Example 1:

> **Input:** s = "Hello World"<br>
**Output:** 5<br>
**Explanation:** The last word is "World" with length 5.

Example 2:

> **Input:** s = "   fly me   to   the moon  "<br>
**Output:** 4<br>
**Explanation:** The last word is "moon" with length 4.

Example 3:

> **Input:** s = "luffy is still joyboy"<br>
**Output:** 6<br>
**Explanation:** The last word is "joyboy" with length 6.
 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= s.length <= 104`
- `s` consists of only English letters and spaces `' '`.
- There will be at least one word in `s`.

# Solution

**Approach:**

The code iterates over the string from right to left. At each iteration, it checks if the current character is a space. If it is, and the previous character was not a space, then the algorithm keeps track of the length of the current word. The algorithm returns the length of the last word when it encounters the first space character or the end of the string.

**Algorithm:**

1. Initialize a variable `length` to -1. This indicates that the current word has not started yet.
2. Iterate over the string from right to left.
    * If the current character is a space and `length` is not equal to -1, then return `length + 1`. This means that we have found the end of the current word.
    * If the current character is not a space, then update `length` to be the length of the current word plus 1.
3. If the loop terminates without returning from the function, then return `length + 1`. This means that the last word in the string is the entire string.

**Here is a more detailed explanation of the algorithm:**
```cpp
int lengthOfLastWord(string &s) {
    int l = s.length();
    int length = -1;
    while(l--){
        if(s[l] == ' ' && length != -1)
            return length+1;
        if(s[l] != ' ')
            length++;
    }
    return length + 1;
}
```

* The first step is to initialize a variable `length` to -1. This indicates that the current word has not started yet.
* The next step is to iterate over the string from right to left.
    * In each iteration, we check if the current character is a space. If it is, and the previous character was not a space, then the algorithm keeps track of the length of the current word.
        * This is because a space character indicates the end of a word. So, if we encounter a space character after a non-space character, then we know that the word that ended at the previous non-space character is the current word.
    * If the current character is not a space, then we update `length` to be the length of the current word plus 1.
        * This is because we are adding one more character to the current word.
* The last step is to check if the loop terminated without returning from the function. If it did, then return `length + 1`. This means that the last word in the string is the entire string.
