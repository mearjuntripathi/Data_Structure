# [415. Add Strings](https://leetcode.com/problems/add-strings/)

Given two non-negative integers, `num1` and `num2` represented as string, return the *sum* of `num1` and `num2` as a string.

You must solve the problem without using any built-in library for handling large integers (such as `BigInteger`). You must also not convert the inputs to integers directly.

 

**Example 1:**

> **Input:** num1 = "11", num2 = "123"<br>
**Output:** "134"

**Example 2:**

> **Input:** num1 = "456", num2 = "77"<br>
**Output:** "533"

**Example 3:**

> **Input:** num1 = "0", num2 = "0"<br>
**Output:** "0"
 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= num1.length, num2.length <= 104`
- `num1` and `num2` consist of only digits.
- `num1` and `num2` don't have any leading zeros except for the zero itself.

# Solution
**Approach:**

The approach is to add the two strings from the rightmost digit to the leftmost digit, carrying over any overflows.

**Algorithm:**

1. Initialize a variable `carry` to 0.
2. If the length of `num1` is less than the length of `num2`, swap the two strings.
3. Initialize variables `l1` and `l2` to the lengths of `num1` and `num2` minus 1, respectively.
4. While `l1` is greater than or equal to 0 or `l2` is greater than or equal to 0:
    * Get the digits `n1` and `n2` from `num1` and `num2` at indexes `l1` and `l2`, respectively.
    * If `n1 + n2 + carry` is greater than 9:
        * Set the digit at `l1` in `num1` to the remainder of `n1 + n2 + carry` divided by 10.
        * Set `carry` to the quotient of `n1 + n2 + carry` divided by 10.
    * Otherwise:
        * Set the digit at `l1` in `num1` to `n1 + n2 + carry`.
        * Set `carry` to 0.
    * Decrement `l1` and `l2`.
5. If `carry` is not equal to 0, append `carry` to `num1`.
6. Return `num1`.

**Here is a breakdown of the algorithm:**
```cpp
string addStrings(string &num1, string &num2) {
    char carry = '0';

    if(num1.length()<num2.length())
        swap(num1,num2);
    
    int l1 = num1.length()-1;
    int l2 = num2.length()-1;

    while(l1 >= 0 || l2 >=0){
        int n1 = l1 < 0 ? 0 : num1[l1] - '0';
        int n2 = l2 < 0 ? 0 : num2[l2] - '0';
        if((n1+n2+(carry-'0')) > 9){
            num1[l1] = (((n1+n2+(carry-'0'))%10) + '0');
            carry = '1';
        }else{
            num1[l1] = ((n1+n2+(carry-'0')) + '0');
            carry = '0';
        }
        l1--;
        l2--;
    }
    num2.erase();
    return (carry != '0') ? carry+num1 : num1;
}
```

* Step 1: Initialize `carry` to 0. This is the value that will be used to carry over any overflows.
* Step 2: If the length of `num1` is less than the length of `num2`, swap the two strings. This ensures that `num1` is always the longer string.
* Step 3: Initialize `l1` and `l2` to the lengths of `num1` and `num2` minus 1, respectively. These variables will be used to iterate over the strings from the rightmost digit to the leftmost digit.
* Step 4: While `l1` is greater than or equal to 0 or `l2` is greater than or equal to 0:
    * Get the digits `n1` and `n2` from `num1` and `num2` at indexes `l1` and `l2`, respectively.
    * Add `n1`, `n2`, and `carry`.
    * If the sum is greater than 9:
        * Set the digit at `l1` in `num1` to the remainder of the sum divided by 10.
        * Set `carry` to the quotient of the sum divided by 10.
    * Otherwise:
        * Set the digit at `l1` in `num1` to the sum.
        * Set `carry` to 0.
    * Decrement `l1` and `l2`.
* Step 5: If `carry` is not equal to 0, append `carry` to `num1`. This is necessary to account for any final overflows.
* Step 6: Return `num1`. This is the resulting string of the addition.
