>**Input:** matrix = [["1","0","1","0","0"],["1","0","1","1","1"],["1","1","1","1","1"],["1","0","0","1","0"]]<br>
**Output:** 4

>**Input:** matrix = [["0","1"],["1","0"]]<br>
**Output:** 1

**Example 3:**

>**Input:** matrix = [["0"]]<br>
**Output:** 0

**Constraints:**

- `m == matrix.length`
- `n == matrix[i].length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 300`
- `matrix[i][j]` is `'0'` or `'1'`.

# Solution

**Approach:**
1. Initialize a 2D vector `dp` of the same size as the input `matrix` to store the maximum square size ending at each cell.
2. Initialize a variable `size` to keep track of the maximum square size encountered.
3. Loop through each cell in the `matrix` from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner.
4. For each cell `(i, j)`, update the `dp[i][j]` value based on the values in adjacent cells. If `matrix[i][j]` is '0', set `dp[i][j]` to 0 because it cannot form a square.
5. If `matrix[i][j]` is '1' and `(i, j)` is not in the first row or first column, calculate `dp[i][j]` as the minimum of the values in the cells above, to the left, and diagonally above-left, and add 1 to it.
6. Update the `size` with the maximum square size encountered during the process.
7. Finally, return `size*size` as the area of the largest square.

**Algorithm:**
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maximalSquare(vector<vector<char>>& matrix) {
        if (matrix.size() < 1)
            return 0;
        
        int row = matrix.size();
        int col = matrix[0].size();

        // Initialize a 2D DP array to store the maximum square size ending at each cell.
        vector<vector<int>> dp(row, vector<int>(col, 0));
        int size = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < row; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < col; j++) {
                if (!i || !j || matrix[i][j] == '0')
                    dp[i][j] = matrix[i][j] - '0';
                else
                    dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][j-1], min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1])) + 1;
                
                // Update the maximum square size encountered.
                size = max(dp[i][j], size);
            }
        }

        // Return the area of the largest square.
        return size * size;
    }
};
```

This algorithm uses dynamic programming to efficiently compute the size of the largest square of '1's in the given binary matrix.
