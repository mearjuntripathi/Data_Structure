# [62. Unique Paths](https://leetcode.com/problems/unique-paths/)

There is a robot on an `m x n` grid. The robot is initially located at the top-left corner (i.e., `grid[0][0]`). The robot tries to move to the bottom-right corner (i.e., `grid[m - 1][n - 1]`). The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time.

Given the two integers `m` and `n`, return the number of possible unique paths that the robot can take to reach the bottom-right corner.

The test cases are generated so that the answer will be less than or equal to `2 * 1e9`.

**Example 1:**

>**Input:** m = 3, n = 7<br>
**Output:** 28

**Example 2:**

>**Input:** m = 3, n = 2<br>
**Output:** 3<br>
**Explanation:** From the top-left corner, there are a total of 3 ways to reach the bottom-right corner:<br>
>1. Right -> Down -> Down<br>
>2. Down -> Down -> Right<br>
>3. Down -> Right -> Down
 

**Constraints:**

> `1 <= m, n <= 100`

# Solution

**Approach:**

This solution uses a **dynamic programming** approach to solve the problem. The idea is to store the number of unique paths from the top-left corner to any point (i, j) in the grid in a two-dimensional table. This table is initialized with -1, which indicates that the number of paths to that point has not yet been calculated.

The recursive function `paths()` takes three arguments:

* `i`: The row index of the current point.
* `j`: The column index of the current point.
* `dp`: The two-dimensional table that stores the number of unique paths to each point in the grid.

The function works as follows:

1. If the current point is outside the grid, return 0.
2. If the current point is the bottom-right corner of the grid, return 1.
3. If the number of unique paths to the current point has already been calculated, return that value.
4. Otherwise, calculate the number of unique paths to the current point as follows:

```
number_of_paths = paths(i + 1, j, dp) + paths(i, j + 1, dp);
```

This is because the only way to reach the current point is either to come from the point above it or to come from the point to its left.

The function then stores the number of unique paths to the current point in the table `dp` and returns that value.

**Algorithm:**

The following algorithm shows how to use the dynamic programming approach to solve the unique paths problem in C++:

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int uniquePaths(int m, int n) {
        vector<vector<int>> dp(m, vector<int> (n, -1));
        return paths(0, 0, m, n, dp);
    }

private:
    int paths(int i, int j, const int &m, const int &n, vector<vector<int>> &dp) {
        if (i >= m || j >= n) {
            return 0;
        }

        if (i == m - 1 && j == n - 1) {
            return 1;
        }

        if (dp[i][j] == -1) {
            dp[i][j] = paths(i + 1, j, m, n, dp) + paths(i, j + 1, m, n, dp);
        }

        return dp[i][j];
    }
};
```

**Usage:**

To use the above solution, simply create an instance of the `Solution` class and call the `uniquePaths()` function with the number of rows and columns in the grid as arguments. The function will return the number of unique paths from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner of the grid.

For example, the following code shows how to use the `uniquePaths()` function to calculate the number of unique paths in a 3x3 grid:

```c++
Solution solution;
int number_of_paths = solution.uniquePaths(3, 3);

cout << "Number of unique paths: " << number_of_paths << endl;
```

Output:

```
Number of unique paths: 6
```
