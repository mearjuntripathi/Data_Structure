# [63. Unique Paths II](https://leetcode.com/problems/unique-paths-ii/)

You are given an `m x n` integer array grid. There is a robot initially located at the top-left corner (i.e., `grid[0][0]`). The robot tries to move to the bottom-right corner (i.e., `grid[m - 1][n - 1]`). The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time.

An obstacle and space are marked as `1` or `0` respectively in `grid`. A path that the robot takes cannot include any square that is an obstacle.

Return the number of possible unique paths that the robot can take to reach the bottom-right corner.

The testcases are generated so that the answer will be less than or equal to `2 * 1e9`.

**Example 1:**

>**Input:** obstacleGrid = [[0,0,0],[0,1,0],[0,0,0]]<br>
**Output:** 2<br>
**Explanation:** There is one obstacle in the middle of the 3x3 grid above.<br>
>There are two ways to reach the bottom-right corner:<br>
>1. Right -> Right -> Down -> Down<br>
>2. Down -> Down -> Right -> Right

**Example 2:**

>**Input:** obstacleGrid = [[0,1],[0,0]]<br>
**Output:** 1
 

**Constraints:**

- `m == obstacleGrid.length`
- `n == obstacleGrid[i].length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 100`
- `obstacleGrid[i][j]` is `0` or `1`.

# Solution

**Approach:**

The approach taken in this solution is to use a dynamic programming approach. We start by initializing the first cell of the grid to 1, since there is only one path to reach this cell from the starting cell. Then, we iterate over the grid, starting at the second row and column. For each cell, we check if it is an obstacle. If it is, we set the number of paths to reach that cell to 0. Otherwise, we set the number of paths to reach that cell to the sum of the number of paths to reach the cell above and the cell to the left. This is because the only two ways to reach the current cell are from the cell above or the cell to the left.

**Algorithm:**

```c++
class Solution {
    int paths(int m, int n, vector<vector<int>> &obstacleGrid){
        obstacleGrid[0][0] = 1;

        for(int i = 0 ; i < m ; i++){
            for(int j = (i ? 0 : 1) ; j < n ; j++){
                if(obstacleGrid[i][j] == 1){
                    obstacleGrid[i][j] = 0;
                    continue;
                }
                if(i > 0) obstacleGrid[i][j] += obstacleGrid[i-1][j];
                if(j > 0) obstacleGrid[i][j] += obstacleGrid[i][j-1];
            }
        }
        return obstacleGrid[m-1][n-1];
    }
public:
    int uniquePathsWithObstacles(vector<vector<int>>& obstacleGrid) {
        int m = obstacleGrid.size();
        int n = obstacleGrid[0].size();
        if(obstacleGrid[0][0] || obstacleGrid[m-1][n-1]) return 0;
        return paths(m,n,obstacleGrid);
    }
};
```

**Complexity:**

The time complexity of this solution is O(m*n), where m and n are the dimensions of the grid. This is because we iterate over the entire grid once. The space complexity of this solution is also O(m*n), since we need to store the number of paths to reach each cell in the grid.
