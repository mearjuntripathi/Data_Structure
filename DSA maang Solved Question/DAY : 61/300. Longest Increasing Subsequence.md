# [300. Longest Increasing Subsequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-increasing-subsequence/)

Given an integer array nums, return the length of the longest strictly increasing subsequence.


**Example 1:**

>**Input:** nums = [10,9,2,5,3,7,101,18]<br>
**Output:** 4<br>
**Explanation:** The longest increasing subsequence is [2,3,7,101], therefore the length is 4.

**Example 2:**

>**Input:** nums = [0,1,0,3,2,3]<br>
**Output:** 4

**Example 3:**

>**Input:** nums = [7,7,7,7,7,7,7]<br>
**Output:** 1
 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 2500`
- `-1e4 <= nums[i] <= 1e4`

**Follow up:** Can you come up with an algorithm that runs in `O(n log(n))` time complexity?

# Solution

The approach of the given C++ solution to the longest increasing subsequence (LIS) problem is to use dynamic programming. The idea is to build a table `dp`, where `dp[i]` represents the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at index `i`.

The algorithm works as follows:

1. Initialize the table `dp` with all ones.
2. Iterate over the array `nums`.
3. For each index `i`, compare `nums[i]` with all the previous elements in the array.
4. If `nums[i]` is greater than `nums[j]`, where `j` is a previous index, and `dp[i]` is less than `dp[j] + 1`, then update `dp[i]` to `dp[j] + 1`.
5. Return the maximum value in the table `dp`.

Here is a more detailed explanation of the algorithm:

```c++
int Solution::lengthOfLIS(vector<int>& nums) {
  int n = nums.size();
  vector<int> dp(n, 1);

  // Initialize the table `dp` with all ones.
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    dp[i] = 1;
  }

  // Iterate over the array `nums`.
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    // Compare `nums[i]` with all the previous elements in the array.
    for (int j = 0; j < i; j++) {
      if (nums[i] > nums[j] && dp[i] < dp[j] + 1) {
        // If `nums[i]` is greater than `nums[j]` and `dp[i]` is less than
        // `dp[j] + 1`, then update `dp[i]` to `dp[j] + 1`.
        dp[i] = dp[j] + 1;
      }
    }
  }

  // Return the maximum value in the table `dp`.
  int maxlength = 0;
  for (auto length : dp) {
    maxlength = max(maxlength, length);
  }
  return maxlength;
}
```

The algorithm has a time complexity of O(n^2) and a space complexity of O(n).

Here is an example of how to use the `Solution` class:

```c++
int main() {
  vector<int> nums = {10, 9, 2, 5, 3, 7, 101, 18};
  Solution solution;
  int lisLength = solution.lengthOfLIS(nums);
  cout << "The length of the longest increasing subsequence is: " << lisLength << endl;
  return 0;
}
```

Output:

```
The length of the longest increasing subsequence is: 4
```
