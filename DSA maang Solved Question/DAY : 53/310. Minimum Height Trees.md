# [310. Minimum Height Trees](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-height-trees/)

A tree is an undirected graph in which any two vertices are connected by exactly one path. In other words, any connected graph without simple cycles is a tree.

Given a tree of `n` nodes labelled from `0` to `n - 1`, and an array of `n - 1` `edges` where `edges[i] = [ai, bi]` indicates that there is an undirected edge between the two nodes `ai` and `bi` in the tree, you can choose any node of the tree as the root. When you select a node `x` as the root, the result tree has height `h`. Among all possible rooted trees, those with minimum height (i.e. `min(h)`)  are called minimum height trees (MHTs).

Return a list of all MHTs' root labels. You can return the answer in any order.

The height of a rooted tree is the number of edges on the longest downward path between the root and a leaf.

**Example 1:**

>**Input:** n = 4, edges = [[1,0],[1,2],[1,3]]<br>
**Output:** [1]<br>
**Explanation:** As shown, the height of the tree is 1 when the root is the node with label 1 which is the only MHT.

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/09/01/e2.jpg)

>**Input:** n = 6, edges = [[3,0],[3,1],[3,2],[3,4],[5,4]]<br>
**Output:** [3,4]
 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= n <= 2 * 1e4`
- `edges.length == n - 1`
- `0 <= ai, bi < n`
- `ai != bi`
- All the pairs `(ai, bi)` are distinct.
- The given input is guaranteed to be a tree and there will be no repeated edges.

# Solution
Here is an approach and algorithm for the C++ solution to the problem of finding the minimum height trees:

**Approach:**

The approach is to use a queue to store the leaf nodes of the tree. We start by initializing the queue with all the nodes that have a degree of 1 (i.e., they are leaf nodes). Then, we repeatedly remove the nodes from the queue and decrement the degree of all their neighbors. If the degree of a neighbor becomes 1, we add it to the queue. This process continues until only a few nodes are left in the queue. These nodes are the minimum height trees of the original tree.

**Algorithm:**
This problem is solved by a topological sort approach. The algorithm is as follows:

1. Create a graph adjacency list.
2. Calculate the degree of each node in the graph.
3. Add all nodes with degree 1 to a queue.
4. While the queue is not empty:
    * Remove a node from the queue.
    * For each neighbor of the node:
        * Decrement the degree of the neighbor.
        * If the degree of the neighbor becomes 1, add it to the queue.
5. Return the nodes in the queue.

This algorithm works because nodes with degree 1 are always leaves in a tree. By repeatedly removing leaves from the tree, we eventually reach a point where the only nodes left are the root nodes of the tree.


```c++
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> findMinHeightTrees(int n, vector<vector<int>>& edges) {
        if(n == 1) return {0};

        vector<vector<int>> graph(n);
        vector<int> degree(n,0);
        for(auto edge : edges){
            graph[edge[0]].push_back(edge[1]);
            graph[edge[1]].push_back(edge[0]);

            degree[edge[0]]++;
            degree[edge[1]]++;
        }

        queue<int> que;

        for(int i = 0 ; i < n ; i++)
            if(degree[i] == 1)
                que.push(i);
        

        while(n > 2){
            int length = que.size();
            n -= length;
            while(length--){
                int node = que.front();
                que.pop();
                for(auto root : graph[node]){
                    degree[root]--;
                    if(degree[root] == 1) 
                        que.push(root);
                }   
            }
        }

        vector<int> roots;

        while(!que.empty()){
            roots.push_back(que.front());
            que.pop();
        }
        return roots;
    }
};
```

**Complexity:**

The time complexity of the algorithm is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree. This is because we visit each node of the tree at most once. The space complexity of the algorithm is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree. This is because we need to store the queue and the degree of each node.
