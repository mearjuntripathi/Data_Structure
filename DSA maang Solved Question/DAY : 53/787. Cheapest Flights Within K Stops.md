# [787. Cheapest Flights Within K Stops](https://leetcode.com/problems/cheapest-flights-within-k-stops/)

There are `n` cities connected by some number of flights. You are given an array `flights` where `flights[i] = [fromi, toi, pricei]` indicates that there is a flight from city `fromi` to city `toi` with cost `pricei`.

You are also given three integers `src`, `dst`, and `k`, return the cheapest price from `src` to `dst` with at most `k` stops. If there is no such route, return `-1`.

 


**Example 1:**

>**Input:** n = 4, flights = [[0,1,100],[1,2,100],[2,0,100],[1,3,600],[2,3,200]], src = 0, dst = 3, k = 1<br>
**Output:** 700<br>
**Explanation:**<br>
The graph is shown above.<br>
The optimal path with at most 1 stop from city 0 to 3 is marked in red and has cost 100 + 600 = 700.
Note that the path through cities [0,1,2,3] is cheaper but is invalid because it uses 2 stops.

**Example 2:**

>**Input:** n = 3, flights = [[0,1,100],[1,2,100],[0,2,500]], src = 0, dst = 2, k = 1<br>
**Output:** 200<br>
**Explanation:**<br>
The graph is shown above.<br>
The optimal path with at most 1 stop from city 0 to 2 is marked in red and has cost 100 + 100 = 200.

**Example 3:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/03/18/cheapest-flights-within-k-stops-2drawio.png)

>**Input:** n = 3, flights = [[0,1,100],[1,2,100],[0,2,500]], src = 0, dst = 2, k = 0<br>
**Output:** 500<br>
**Explanation:**<br>
The graph is shown above.<br>
The optimal path with no stops from city 0 to 2 is marked in red and has cost 500.
 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= n <= 100`
- `0 <= flights.length <= (n * (n - 1) / 2)`
- `flights[i].length == 3`
- `0 <= fromi, toi < n`
- `fromi != toi`
- `1 <= pricei <= 1e4`
- There will not be any multiple flights between two cities.
- `0 <= src, dst, k < n`
- `src != dst`

# Solution

The approach for the C++ solution to the problem of finding the cheapest price with at most k stops is to use a priority queue to implement Dijkstra's algorithm. The priority queue will keep track of the nodes that need to be visited, and the distance from the source node to each node. The algorithm will start at the source node and iterate over the nodes in the priority queue, visiting the node with the shortest distance from the source node first. If the node that is visited is the destination node, then the algorithm will terminate and return the distance from the source node to the destination node. Otherwise, the algorithm will add all of the neighbors of the current node to the priority queue, with the distance from the source node to each neighbor updated to include the cost of the flight from the current node to the neighbor.

Here is a more detailed algorithm:

1. Initialize a priority queue `q` to be empty.
2. Initialize a distance array `dis` to be `INT_MAX` for all nodes.
3. Set `dis[src] = 0`.
4. Add the source node to the priority queue with priority `0`.
5. While the priority queue is not empty:
    * Remove the node with the highest priority from the priority queue and assign it to `u`.
    * If `u` is the destination node, then terminate the algorithm and return `dis[u]`.
    * For each neighbor `v` of `u`:
        * If `dis[u] + cost(u, v) < dis[v]`, then update `dis[v] = dis[u] + cost(u, v)` and add `v` to the priority queue with priority `dis[v]`.

The time complexity of the algorithm is O(V^2 log V), where V is the number of nodes in the graph. The space complexity of the algorithm is O(V), where V is the number of nodes in the graph.

Here is an example of how to use the algorithm in C++:

```c++
#include <queue>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    vector<pair<int, int>> adj[105];
    int findCheapestPrice(int n, vector<vector<int>>& flights, int src, int dst, int k) {
        for (int i = 0; i < flights.size(); i++) {
            adj[flights[i][0]].push_back({flights[i][1], flights[i][2]});
        }

        vector<int> dis(n, INT_MAX);
        priority_queue<pair<int, int>, vector<pair<int, int>>, greater<pair<int, int>>> q;
        q.push({0, src});
        dis[src] = 0;

        while (!q.empty()) {
            auto p = q.top();
            q.pop();

            int stop = p.first;
            int u = p.second;

            if (stop > k + 1) {
                continue;
            }

            for (auto i : adj[u]) {
                int v = i.first;
                int d = i.second;

                if (d + dis[u] < dis[v]) {
                    dis[v] = d + dis[u];
                    q.push({stop + 1, v});
                }
            }
        }

        if (dis[dst] == INT_MAX) {
            return -1;
        }

        return dis[dst];
    }
};
