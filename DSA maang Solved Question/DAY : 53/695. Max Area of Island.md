# [695. Max Area of Island](https://leetcode.com/problems/max-area-of-island/)

You are given an `m x n` binary matrix `grid`. An island is a group of `1`'s (representing land) connected 4-directionally (horizontal or vertical.) You may assume all four edges of the grid are surrounded by water.

The area of an island is the number of cells with a value `1` in the island.

Return the maximum area of an island in `grid`. If there is no island, return `0`.

 


**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/05/01/maxarea1-grid.jpg)

>**Input:** grid = [[0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0],[0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0],[0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0]]<br>
**Output:** 6<br>
**Explanation:** The answer is not 11, because the island must be connected 4-directionally.

**Example 2:**

>**Input:** grid = [[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]]<br>
**Output:** 0
 

Constraints:

- `m == grid.length`
- `n == grid[i].length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 50`
- `grid[i][j]` is either `0` or `1`.

# Solution

The approach taken in this solution is to use a depth-first search (DFS) to traverse the grid and find all of the connected 1's. The algorithm is as follows:

1. Initialize the row and col variables to the height and width of the grid, respectively.
2. Initialize the maxArea variable to 0.
3. Initialize the sum variable to 0.
4. Iterate over the grid:
    * If the current cell is 1 and has not yet been visited:
        * Mark the cell as visited.
        * Increment the sum variable.
        * Recursively call the DFS function on the four adjacent cells.
5. After the DFS function has finished executing, the sum variable will contain the area of the largest island in the grid.
6. Update the maxArea variable if the sum variable is greater than maxArea.
7. Return the maxArea variable.

The algorithm works by recursively exploring the grid, starting from each cell that is 1 and has not yet been visited. As the algorithm explores the grid, it marks each cell that it visits as visited and increments the sum variable. The algorithm terminates when it has reached a cell that is 0 or a cell that has already been visited.

The algorithm is written in C++ as follows:

```c++
class Solution {
    int row, col;
    int maxArea = 0;
    int sum = 0;
    void dfs(int i, int j, vector<vector<int>>& grid){
        if(i < 0 || j < 0 || i >=row || j >= col || grid[i][j] == 0) return;
            grid[i][j] = 0;
        sum ++;
        dfs(i-1, j, grid);
        dfs(i, j-1, grid);
        dfs(i+1, j, grid);
        dfs(i, j+1, grid);
    }
public:
    int maxAreaOfIsland(vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
        row = grid.size();
        col = grid[0].size();

        for(int i = 0 ; i < row ; i++)
            for(int j = 0 ; j < col ; j++)
                if(grid[i][j]){
                    sum = 0;
                    dfs(i,j,grid);
                    maxArea = max(maxArea, sum);
                }
            
        return maxArea;
    }
};
```

To use the solution, simply create an instance of the `Solution` class and call the `maxAreaOfIsland()` function, passing in the grid as a parameter. The function will return the maximum area of an island in the grid.
