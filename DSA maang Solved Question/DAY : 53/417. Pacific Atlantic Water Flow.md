# [417. Pacific Atlantic Water Flow](https://leetcode.com/problems/pacific-atlantic-water-flow/)

There is an `m x n` rectangular island that borders both the Pacific Ocean and Atlantic Ocean. The Pacific Ocean touches the island's left and top edges, and the Atlantic Ocean touches the island's right and bottom edges.

The island is partitioned into a grid of square cells. You are given an `m x n` integer matrix `heights` where `heights[r][c]` represents the height above sea level of the cell at coordinate `(r, c)`.

The island receives a lot of rain, and the rain water can flow to neighboring cells directly north, south, east, and west if the neighboring cell's height is less than or equal to the current cell's height. Water can flow from any cell adjacent to an ocean into the ocean.

Return a 2D list of grid coordinates `result` where `result[i] = [ri, ci]` denotes that rain water can flow from cell `(ri, ci)` to both the Pacific and Atlantic oceans.

**Example 1:**

>**Input:** heights = [[1,2,2,3,5],[3,2,3,4,4],[2,4,5,3,1],[6,7,1,4,5],[5,1,1,2,4]]<br>
**Output:** [[0,4],[1,3],[1,4],[2,2],[3,0],[3,1],[4,0]]<br>
**Explanation:** The following cells can flow to the Pacific and Atlantic oceans, as shown below:
><pre>
>[0,4]: [0,4] -> Pacific Ocean 
>       [0,4] -> Atlantic Ocean
>[1,3]: [1,3] -> [0,3] -> Pacific Ocean 
>       [1,3] -> [1,4] -> Atlantic Ocean
>[1,4]: [1,4] -> [1,3] -> [0,3] -> Pacific Ocean 
>       [1,4] -> Atlantic Ocean
>[2,2]: [2,2] -> [1,2] -> [0,2] -> Pacific Ocean 
>       [2,2] -> [2,3] -> [2,4] -> Atlantic Ocean
>[3,0]: [3,0] -> Pacific Ocean 
>       [3,0] -> [4,0] -> Atlantic Ocean
>[3,1]: [3,1] -> [3,0] -> Pacific Ocean 
>       [3,1] -> [4,1] -> Atlantic Ocean
>[4,0]: [4,0] -> Pacific Ocean 
>       [4,0] -> Atlantic Ocean
></pre>
>Note that there are other possible paths for these cells to flow to the Pacific and Atlantic oceans.

**Example 2:**

>**Input:** heights = [[1]]<br>
**Output:** [[0,0]]<br>
**Explanation:** The water can flow from the only cell to the Pacific and Atlantic oceans.
 

Constraints:

- `m == heights.length`
- `n == heights[r].length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 200`
- `0 <= heights[r][c] <= 1e5`

# Solution

**Approach**

The approach for the given solution is to use a depth-first search (DFS) traversal to mark all the cells that are reachable from the Pacific and Atlantic oceans separately. Once all the reachable cells from both oceans have been marked, we can return the cells that are marked by both oceans.

**Algorithm**

The following is a step-by-step algorithm for the given C++ solution:

1. Create two boolean matrices, `pacific` and `atlantic`, to keep track of the cells that are reachable from the Pacific and Atlantic oceans, respectively.
2. Initialize all cells in both matrices to `false`.
3. Perform a DFS traversal from all the cells that are directly connected to the Pacific ocean. During the DFS traversal, mark all the visited cells in the `pacific` matrix to `true`.
4. Perform a DFS traversal from all the cells that are directly connected to the Atlantic ocean. During the DFS traversal, mark all the visited cells in the `atlantic` matrix to `true`.
5. Iterate over the entire matrix and return all the cells that are marked as `true` in both the `pacific` and `atlantic` matrices.

**C++ Implementation**

The following is a C++ implementation of the above algorithm:

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> pacificAtlantic(vector<vector<int>>& heights) {
        int n = heights.size(), m = heights[0].size();
        vector<vector<bool>> pacific(n, vector<bool>(m, false)), atlantic(n, vector<bool>(m, false));

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            dfs(heights, pacific, i, 0);
            dfs(heights, atlantic, i, m - 1);
        }
        for (int j = 0; j < m; j++) {
            dfs(heights, pacific, 0, j);
            dfs(heights, atlantic, n - 1, j);
        }

        vector<vector<int>> result;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < m; j++) {
                if (pacific[i][j] && atlantic[i][j]) {
                    result.push_back({i, j});
                }
            }
        }
        return result;
    }

private:
    void dfs(vector<vector<int>>& heights, vector<vector<bool>>& visited, int i, int j) {
        if (visited[i][j]) return;
        visited[i][j] = true;

        if (i > 0 && heights[i][j] >= heights[i - 1][j]) dfs(heights, visited, i - 1, j);
        if (j > 0 && heights[i][j] >= heights[i][j - 1]) dfs(heights, visited, i, j - 1);
        if (i < heights.size() - 1 && heights[i][j] >= heights[i + 1][j]) dfs(heights, visited, i + 1, j);
        if (j < heights[0].size() - 1 && heights[i][j] >= heights[i][j + 1]) dfs(heights, visited, i, j + 1);
    }
};
