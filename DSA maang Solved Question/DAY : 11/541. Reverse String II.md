# [541. Reverse String II](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-string-ii/)

Given a string `s` and an integer `k`, reverse the first k characters for every 2k characters counting from the start of the string.

If there are fewer than `k` characters left, reverse all of them. If there are less than `2k` but greater than or equal to `k` characters, then reverse the first `k` characters and leave the other as original.

 

**Example 1:**

> **Input:** s = "abcdefg", k = 2<br>
**Output:** "bacdfeg"

**Example 2:**

> **Input:** s = "abcd", k = 2<br>
**Output:** "bacd"
 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= s.length <= 104`
- `s` consists of only lowercase English letters.
- `1 <= k <= 104`

# Solution

**Approach:**

The code takes a string `s` and an integer `k` as input. It iterates over the string starting from index 0, and increments the step by 2k. For each iteration, it reverses the substring from index `i` to `i + k`. If the length of the substring is less than `k`, then the entire substring is reversed.

**Algorithm:**

1. Initialize a variable `i` to 0.
2. While `i` is less than the length of the string `s`:
    * If `i + k` is less than the length of the string `s`:
        * Reverse the substring from index `i` to `i + k`.
    * Else:
        * Reverse the entire substring from index `i` to the end of the string.
    * Increment `i` by 2k.
3. Return the reversed string.

**Here is a more detailed explanation of the algorithm:**
```cpp
string reverseStr(string s, int k) {
    for(int i=0;i<s.size();i+=2*k){
        if(i+k<=s.size()){
            reverse(s.begin()+i,s.begin()+i+k);
        }else{
            reverse(s.begin()+i,s.end());
        }
    }
    return s;
}
```

1. The first step is to initialize a variable `i` to 0. This variable will be used to track the current position in the string.
2. The second step is to start a loop. The loop will iterate over the string starting from index 0. The condition for the loop is `i < s.size()`, which means that the loop will continue as long as `i` is less than the length of the string `s`.
3. In each iteration of the loop, the code checks if the length of the substring from index `i` to `i + k` is less than `k`. If it is, then the entire substring is reversed. Otherwise, only the substring from index `i` to `i + k` is reversed.
4. After reversing the substring, the code increments `i` by 2k. This ensures that the next iteration of the loop will start at the next 2k characters.
5. The loop ends when `i` reaches the end of the string.
6. Finally, the reversed string is returned.
