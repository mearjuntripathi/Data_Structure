# [344. Reverse String](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-string/description/)

Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters s.

You must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

 

**Example 1:**

> Input: s = ["h","e","l","l","o"]<br>
Output: ["o","l","l","e","h"]

**Example 2:**

> Input: s = ["H","a","n","n","a","h"]<br>
Output: ["h","a","n","n","a","H"]
 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= s.length <= 105`
- `s[i]` is a [printable ascii character](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#Printable_characters).

# Solution
**Approach:**

The approach is to use the following steps to reverse the string:

1. Initialize two pointers `i` and `j` to the beginning and end of the string, respectively.
2. While `i` is less than `j`:
    * Swap the characters at `i` and `j`.
    * Increment `i`.
    * Decrement `j`.

**Algorithm:**

```cpp
void reverseString(vector<char>& s) {
  int i = 0;
  int j = s.size() - 1;

  while (i < j) {
    char temp = s[i];
    s[i] = s[j];
    s[j] = temp;
    i++;
    j--;
  }
}
```

**Explanation:**

The first step is to initialize the pointers `i` and `j`. Pointer `i` will start at the beginning of the string and pointer `j` will start at the end of the string.

The next step is to enter a loop. The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `j`.

Inside the loop, the characters at `i` and `j` are swapped. This is done by first storing the character at `i` in a temporary variable. Then, the character at `j` is stored at `i`. Finally, the character that was stored in the temporary variable is stored at `j`.

After the characters are swapped, the pointers `i` and `j` are incremented and decremented, respectively. This ensures that the next iteration of the loop will swap the characters at the next two positions in the string.

The loop will terminate when `i` is equal to `j`. This means that all of the characters in the string have been swapped.

Here is an example of how the algorithm works:

```
string s = "hello";

reverseString(s);

cout << s << endl;
```

This code will print the following output:
