# [1047. Remove All Adjacent Duplicates In String](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-all-adjacent-duplicates-in-string/)

You are given a string `s` consisting of lowercase English letters. A duplicate removal consists of choosing two adjacent and equal letters and removing them.

We repeatedly make **duplicate removals** on `s` until we no longer can.

Return the *final string after all such duplicate removals have been made*. It can be proven that the answer is *unique*.

 

**Example 1:**

> **Input:** s = "abbaca"<br>
**Output:** "ca"<br>
**Explanation:**<br>
For example, in "abbaca" we could remove "bb" since the letters are adjacent and equal, and this is the only possible move.  The result of this move is that the string is "aaca", of which only "aa" is possible, so the final string is "ca".

**Example 2:**

> **Input:** s = "azxxzy"<br>
**Output:** "ay"
 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= s.length <= 105`
- `s` consists of lowercase English letters.

# Solution

**Approach:**

The approach is to scan the string from left to right, and keep track of the last unique character seen so far. If the current character is the same as the last unique character, then we skip it. Otherwise, we add it to the result string.

**Algorithm:**

1. Initialize a string `ans` to store the resulting string without duplicates.
2. Initialize an index `i` to 0.
3. Iterate over the characters of the string `s`:
    * If the length of `ans` is greater than 0 and the last character of `ans` is equal to `ch`:
        * Remove the last character from `ans`.
        * Continue to the next iteration.
    * Otherwise:
        * Append `ch` to `ans`.
4. Clear the string `s`.
5. Return `ans`.

**Here is a detailed explanation of each step:**
```cpp
string removeDuplicates(string s) {
    string ans ="";
    int i=0;
    for(char ch  : s){
        if(ans.length() > 0 && ans[ans.length()-1]==ch){
            ans.pop_back();
            continue;
        }
        ans.push_back(ch);
    }
    s.clear();
    return ans;
}
```

1. We initialize a string `ans` to store the resulting string without duplicates. This string will be empty at first, but will grow as we add unique characters to it.
2. We initialize an index `i` to 0. This index will be used to track the current character in the string `s`.
3. We iterate over the characters of the string `s`:
    * We check if the length of `ans` is greater than 0. This means that there is at least one character in the resulting string.
    * We then check if the last character of `ans` is equal to the current character `ch`. If it is, then we skip this character because it is a duplicate.
    * Otherwise, we append the current character `ch` to the end of the resulting string `ans`.
4. After we have iterated over all the characters of the string `s`, we clear the string `s`. This is because we no longer need it.
5. Finally, we return the resulting string `ans`.

This algorithm works by maintaining a sliding window of unique characters. The window starts with the first character of the string. As we iterate over the characters of the string, we add each unique character to the window. If we encounter a duplicate character, we remove it from the window. The resulting string is the concatenation of all the characters in the window.

The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n), where n is the length of the string. The space complexity of this algorithm is O(n), where n is the length of the resulting string.

I hope this explanation is helpful! Let me know if you have any other questions.
