# [205. Isomorphic Strings](https://leetcode.com/problems/isomorphic-strings/)

Given two strings `s` and `t`, determine if they are isomorphic.

Two strings `s` and `t` are isomorphic if the characters in `s` can be replaced to get `t`.

All occurrences of a character must be replaced with another character while preserving the order of characters. No two characters may map to the same character, but a character may map to itself.

 

**Example 1:**

> **Input:** s = "egg", t = "add"<br>
**Output:** true

**Example 2:**

> **Input:** s = "foo", t = "bar"<br>
**Output:** false

**Example 3:**

> **Input:** s = "paper", t = "title"<br>
**Output:** true
 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= s.length <= 5 * 104`
- `t.length == s.length`
- `s` and `t` consist of any valid ascii character.

# Solution

The code you have provided is a function that determines if two strings are isomorphic. Two strings are said to be isomorphic if there is a one-to-one correspondence between the characters of the two strings such that the order of the characters is preserved.

The approach used by the code is to create two maps, one for each string. The keys of the maps are the characters of the strings, and the values of the maps are the indices of the characters in the strings.

```cpp
bool isIsomorphic(string s, string t) {
    // map<char,char> mp;

    // for(int i = 0 ; i < s.length() ; i++){
    //     if(mp.count(s[i])){
    //         if(mp[s[i]] != t[i])
    //             return false;
    //     }else if(any_of(mp.begin(), mp.end(), [&](const auto& pair) { return pair.second == t[i]; })){
    //         return false;
    //     }
    //     else mp[s[i]] = t[i];
    // }

    int st[256] = {0};
    int tt[256] = {0};
    for(int i = 0;i<s.length();i++){
        if(st[s[i]] != tt[t[i]])
            return false;
        st[s[i]] = i+1;
        tt[t[i]] = i+1;
    }
    return true;
}
```

The code then iterates over the characters of the first string. For each character, it checks the following:

* If the character is already in the map, then the code checks if the value associated with the character in the first map is equal to the value associated with the character in the second map. If they are not equal, then the code returns False.
* If the character is not in the map, then the code checks if the value associated with the character in the second map is already used by another character in the first map. If it is, then the code returns False.
* Otherwise, the code adds the character to the map and assigns it the next available index.

If the code reaches the end of the first string without returning False, then it returns True, indicating that the two strings are isomorphic.

**Here is a more detailed explanation of the algorithm:**

1. Create two maps, `st` and `tt`, to store the mappings from characters in the strings `s` and `t` to indices.
2. Iterate over the characters of the string `s`.
    * For each character, `c`, do the following:
        * If `c` is already in the map `st`, then check if the value associated with `c` in `st` is equal to the value associated with `c` in `tt`. If they are not equal, then return False.
        * If `c` is not in the map `st`, then check if the value associated with `c` in `tt` is already used by another character in `s`. If it is, then return False.
        * Otherwise, add `c` to the map `st` and assign it the next available index.
3. If the code reaches the end of the string `s` without returning False, then return True.
