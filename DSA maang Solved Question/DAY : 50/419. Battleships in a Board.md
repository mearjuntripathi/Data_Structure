# [419. Battleships in a Board](https://leetcode.com/problems/battleships-in-a-board/)

Given an `m x n` matrix board where each cell is a battleship `'X'` or empty `'.'`, return the number of the **battleships** on `board`.

Battleships can only be placed horizontally or vertically on `board`. In other words, they can only be made of the shape `1 x k` (`1` row, `k` columns) or `k x 1` (`k` rows, `1` column), where `k` can be of any size. At least one horizontal or vertical cell separates between two battleships (i.e., there are no adjacent battleships).

**Example 1:**

>**Input:** board = [["X",".",".","X"],[".",".",".","X"],[".",".",".","X"]]<br>
**Output:** 2

**Example 2:**

>**Input:** board = [["."]]<br>
**Output:** 0
 

**Constraints:**

- `m == board.length`
- `n == board[i].length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 200`
- `board[i][j]` is either `'.'` or `'X'`.
 

**Follow up:** Could you do it in one-pass, using only `O(1)` extra memory and without modifying the values board?

# Solution

**Brute force approach**
The approach of the given C++ solution is to iterate over the board matrix and count the number of battleships. A battleship is counted if it is the first 'X' in its row and column. This means that if the current cell is an 'X' and the cell above it or to the left of it is also an 'X', then the current cell is not part of a battleship and is not counted.

The algorithm is as follows:

1. Initialize the count of battleships to 0.
2. Iterate over the board matrix.
3. For each cell in the matrix, check if it is an 'X'.
4. If the cell is an 'X' and the cell above it or to the left of it is not an 'X', then increment the count of battleships.
5. Return the count of battleships.

Here is a step-by-step explanation of the code:

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int countBattleships(vector<vector<char>>& board) {
        // Initialize the count of battleships to 0.
        int battle = 0;

        // Iterate over the board matrix.
        for(int i = 0 ; i < board.size() ; i++){
            for(int j = 0 ; j < board[i].size() ; j++){

                // Check if the current cell is an 'X'.
                if(board[i][j] == 'X'){

                    // Check if the cell above it or to the left of it is an 'X'.
                    if((i > 0 && board[i-1][j] == 'X') || (j > 0 && board[i][j-1] == 'X'))
                        continue;

                    // If the current cell is the first 'X' in its row and column,
                    // then increment the count of battleships.
                    battle++;
                }
            }
        }

        // Return the count of battleships.
        return battle;
    }
};
```

This solution is efficient because it only needs to iterate over the board matrix once. It also has a constant space complexity because it only uses a single variable to store the count of battleships.

**Optimal Approach**

The approach of this C++ solution for counting battleships in a board is to use a depth-first search (DFS). The DFS algorithm starts at a given cell and recursively explores all of its neighbors, marking each visited cell as '.' (empty). If the current cell is a battleship ('X'), then the algorithm increments the counter for the number of battleships.

The algorithm is implemented in the following steps:

1. Define a recursive function `DFS()`, which takes a vector of vectors of characters (representing the board) and the row and column indices of the current cell as input.
2. Check if the current cell is out of bounds or if it is empty. If so, return.
3. Mark the current cell as empty.
4. Recursively call `DFS()` on the four neighboring cells (up, down, left, and right).
5. The `countBattleships()` function iterates over all of the cells in the board and calls `DFS()` on each cell that is a battleship. The function returns the counter for the number of battleships.

Here is a detailed explanation of the algorithm:

```c++
void DFS(vector<vector<char>> &board, const int &i, const int &j){
    // Check if the current cell is out of bounds or if it is empty.
    if(i < 0 || i >= board.size() || j < 0 || j >= board[0].size() || board[i][j] == '.') return;

    // Mark the current cell as empty.
    board[i][j] = '.';

    // Recursively call DFS on the four neighboring cells (up, down, left, and right).
    DFS(board,i-1,j);
    DFS(board,i,j-1);
    DFS(board,i+1,j);
    DFS(board,i,j+1);
}
```

The `countBattleships()` function is implemented as follows:

```c++
int countBattleships(vector<vector<char>>& board) {
    // Initialize the counter for the number of battleships.
    int battle = 0;

    // Iterate over all of the cells in the board.
    for(int i = 0 ; i < board.size() ; i++){
        for(int j = 0 ; j < board[i].size() ; j++){
            // If the current cell is a battleship, call DFS to mark it and all of its connected cells as empty.
            if(board[i][j] == 'X'){
                battle++;
                DFS(board,i,j);
            }
        }
    }

    // Return the counter for the number of battleships.
    return battle;
}
```

This algorithm is efficient and easy to implement. It also has the advantage of being able to count battleships of any size and shape.
