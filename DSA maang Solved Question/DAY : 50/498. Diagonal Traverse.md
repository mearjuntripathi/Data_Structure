Given an `m x n` matrix `mat`, return an array of all the elements of the array in a diagonal order.

 

**Example 1:**

>**Input:** mat = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]<br>
**Output:** [1,2,4,7,5,3,6,8,9]

**Example 2:**

>**Input:** mat = [[1,2],[3,4]]<br>
**Output:** [1,2,3,4]
 

**Constraints:**

- `m == mat.length`
- `n == mat[i].length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 1e4`
- `1 <= m * n <= 1e4`
- `-1e5 <= mat[i][j] <= 1e5`

# Solution

This solution to the problem of finding the diagonal order of a matrix in C++ works by iteratively traversing the matrix in a zig-zag pattern, starting at the top left corner and ending at the bottom right corner. The algorithm can be summarized as follows:

1. Initialize two indices, `row` and `col`, to the top left corner of the matrix.
2. Set a flag, `up`, to `true`.
3. While `row` is less than the number of rows in the matrix and `col` is less than the number of columns in the matrix:
    * If `up` is `true`:
        * Add the element at `mat[row][col]` to the result vector.
        * If `col` is less than the number of columns in the matrix minus one and `row` is greater than zero, then decrement `row` and increment `col`.
        * Otherwise, increment `row`.
    * Otherwise:
        * Add the element at `mat[row][col]` to the result vector.
        * If `row` is less than the number of rows in the matrix minus one and `col` is greater than zero, then increment `row` and decrement `col`.
        * Otherwise, increment `col`.
4. Flip the value of `up`.
5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 until `row` is greater than or equal to the number of rows in the matrix or `col` is greater than or equal to the number of columns in the matrix.

The following is a C++ implementation of the algorithm:

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> findDiagonalOrder(vector<vector<int>>& mat) {
        int m = mat.size();
        int n = mat[0].size();
        if(m == 0 || n == 0)return {};
        int row = 0;
        int col = 0 ;
        vector<int> result;
        bool up = true;
        while(row < m && col < n){
            // upward
            if(up){
                while(row > 0 && col < n-1){
                    result.push_back(mat[row--][col++]);
                }
                result.push_back(mat[row][col]);
                if(col == n-1){
                    row++;
                }else{
                    col++;
                }
            }// downword
            else{
                while(row < m-1 && col > 0){
                    result.push_back(mat[row++][col--]);
                }
                result.push_back(mat[row][col]);
                if(row == m-1){
                    col++;
                }else{
                    row++;
                }
            }
            up = !up; 
        }
        return result;
    }
};
```

This algorithm is efficient because it only needs to traverse the matrix once. It is also easy to understand and implement.
