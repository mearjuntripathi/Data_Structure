# [143. Reorder List](https://leetcode.com/problems/reorder-list/)

You are given the head of a singly linked-list. The list can be represented as:

> `L0 → L1 → … → Ln - 1 → Ln`

Reorder the list to be on the following form:

> `L0 → Ln → L1 → Ln - 1 → L2 → Ln - 2 → …`

You may not modify the values in the list's nodes. Only nodes themselves may be changed.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/03/04/reorder1linked-list.jpg)

>**Input:** head = [1,2,3,4]<br>
**Output:** [1,4,2,3]

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/03/09/reorder2-linked-list.jpg)

>**Input:** head = [1,2,3,4,5]<br>
**Output:** [1,5,2,4,3]

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the list is in the range `[1, 5 * 104]`.
- `1 <= Node.val <= 1000`

# Solution

This solution to the Reorder Linked List problem uses two approaches:

**Approach 1 using reverse:**

This approach uses O(n) time and O(1) space.

1. Find the middle node of the linked list using the slow and fast pointer approach.
2. Reverse the second half of the linked list.
3. Merge the two halves of the linked list alternately.

**Algorithm:**

```c++
class Solution {
    ListNode* reverse(ListNode* head) {
        if (head == nullptr || head->next == nullptr) {
            return head;
        }

        ListNode* reversedList = reverse(head->next);
        head->next->next = head;
        head->next = nullptr;

        return reversedList;
    }
public:
    void reorderList(ListNode* head) {
        // Approach 1 using reverse

        // If the linked list is empty or has only one node, there is nothing to do.
        if (head == nullptr || head->next == nullptr) {
            return;
        }

        // Find the middle node of the linked list.
        ListNode* slow = head;
        ListNode* fast = head;
        while (fast != nullptr && fast->next != nullptr) {
            slow = slow->next;
            fast = fast->next->next;
        }

        // Reverse the second half of the linked list.
        ListNode* reversedSecondHalf = reverse(slow->next);
        slow->next = nullptr;

        // Merge the two halves of the linked list alternately.
        ListNode* current = head;
        ListNode* next;
        while (reversedSecondHalf != nullptr) {
            next = current->next;
            current->next = reversedSecondHalf;
            reversedSecondHalf = reversedSecondHalf->next;
            current->next->next = next;
            current = next;
        }
    }
};
```

**Approach 2 using stack:**

This approach uses O(n) time and O(n) space.

1. Push all the nodes of the linked list onto a stack.
2. Iterate over the linked list and pop the top node from the stack alternately.
3. Set the next pointer of the current node to the popped node.

**Algorithm:**

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    void reorderList(ListNode* head) {
        // Approach 2 using stack

        // Create a stack to store the nodes in the second half of the linked list.
        stack<ListNode*> st;

        // Iterate over the linked list, pushing the nodes in the second half onto
        // the stack.
        ListNode* curr = head;
        while (curr != nullptr) {
            st.push(curr);
            curr = curr->next;
        }

        // Iterate over the linked list again, popping nodes from the stack and
        // inserting them into the linked list alternately.
        curr = head;
        while (!st.empty()) {
            ListNode* node = st.top();
            st.pop();

            node->next = curr->next;
            curr->next = node;
            curr = node->next;
        }

        // Set the next pointer of the last node in the linked list to nullptr.
        curr->next = nullptr;
    }
};
```

Which approach to use depends on the specific requirements of the problem. If space is a constraint, then Approach 1 is a good choice. However, if time is a constraint, then Approach 2 may be a better choice.
