# [328. Odd Even Linked List](https://leetcode.com/problems/odd-even-linked-list/)

Given the `head` of a singly linked list, group all the nodes with odd indices together followed by the nodes with even indices, and return the reordered list.

The first node is considered **odd**, and the **second** node is **even**, and so on.

Note that the relative order inside both the even and odd groups should remain as it was in the input.

You must solve the problem in `O(1)` extra space complexity and `O(n)` time complexity.

 


**Example 1:**

>**Input:** head = [1,2,3,4,5]<br>
**Output:** [1,3,5,2,4]

**Example 2:**

>**Input:** head = [2,1,3,5,6,4,7]<br>
**Output:** [2,3,6,7,1,5,4]
 

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the linked list is in the range `[0, 104]`.
- `-106 <= Node.val <= 1e6`

# Solution

The approach of the solution to the `oddEvenList()` problem in C++ is to maintain two pointers, `odd` and `even`, which point to the current odd and even nodes, respectively. The algorithm works as follows:

1. Initialize the two pointers, `odd` and `even`, to the head and next node of the linked list, respectively.
2. While the `even` pointer is not null and its next node is not null:
    * Connect the current odd node to the next odd node.
    * Move the `odd` pointer to the next odd node.
    * Connect the current even node to the next even node.
    * Move the `even` pointer to the next even node.
3. Connect the last odd node to the head of the even list.
4. Return the head of the linked list.

Here is the C++ implementation of the algorithm:

```c++ []
class Solution {
public:
    ListNode* oddEvenList(ListNode* head) {
        if (!head || !head->next) {
            return head; // No need to process if there are 0 or 1 nodes.
        }

        ListNode* odd = head;
        ListNode* even = head->next;
        ListNode* evenHead = even; // Remember the head of the even list.

        while (even && even->next) {
            odd->next = even->next; // Connect odd node to next odd node.
            odd = odd->next;
            even->next = odd->next; // Connect even node to next even node.
            even = even->next;
        }

        odd->next = evenHead; // Connect the last odd node to the even list.
        return head;
    }
};
```

This algorithm is time-efficient and space-efficient. It uses O(n) time to traverse the linked list once and O(1) space to maintain the two pointers.
