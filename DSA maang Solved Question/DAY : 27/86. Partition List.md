# [86. Partition List](https://leetcode.com/problems/partition-list/)

Given the `head` of a linked list and a value `x`, partition it such that all nodes less than `x` come before nodes greater than or equal to `x`.

You should **preserve** the original relative order of the nodes in each of the two partitions.

 
Example 1:

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/01/04/partition.jpg)

Input: head = [1,4,3,2,5,2], x = 3
Output: [1,2,2,4,3,5]
Example 2:

Input: head = [2,1], x = 2
Output: [1,2]
 

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the list is in the range `[0, 200]`.
- `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`
- `-200 <= x <= 200`

# Solution
The approach for this solution is to create two linked lists, one for nodes with values less than `x` and the other for nodes with values greater than or equal to `x`. We then iterate over the original linked list and add each node to the appropriate list. Finally, we join the two lists together and return the head of the new list.

The algorithm for this solution is as follows:

1. Initialize two pointers, `first` and `last`, to point to the heads of the two new linked lists.
2. Iterate over the original linked list, starting with the head node.
3. For each node in the original linked list:
    * If the node's value is less than `x`, add it to the list headed by `first`.
    * Otherwise, add it to the list headed by `last`.
4. If the list headed by `first` is empty, return the head of the list headed by `last`.
5. Otherwise, append the list headed by `last` to the list headed by `first`.
6. Return the head of the list headed by `first`.

Here is a C++ implementation of the above algorithm:

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    ListNode* partition(ListNode* head, int x) {
        ListNode *first = NULL;
        ListNode *last = NULL;
        ListNode *t = NULL;
        ListNode *temp = head;
        while(temp){
            if(temp->val < x){
                if(first == NULL){
                    first = temp;
                    head = first;
                }else{
                    first->next = temp;
                    first = first->next;
                }
            }else{
                if(last == NULL){
                    last = temp;
                    t = last;
                }else{
                    last->next = temp;
                    last = last->next;
                }
            }
            temp = temp->next;
        }
        if(first == NULL)
            return t;
        if(t)
            last->next = NULL;
        first->next = t;
        return head;
    }
};
```

This C++ implementation of the partition algorithm is time-efficient and space-efficient. It uses O(n) time to iterate over the original linked list and O(1) space to store the two pointers `first` and `last`.
