# [73. Set Matrix Zeroes](https://leetcode.com/problems/set-matrix-zeroes/)

Given an `m x n` integer matrix matrix, if an element is `0`, set its entire row and column to `0's`.

You must do it in place.

**Example 1:**

>**Input:** matrix = [[1,1,1],[1,0,1],[1,1,1]]<br>
**Output:** [[1,0,1],[0,0,0],[1,0,1]]

**Example 2:**

>**Input:** matrix = [[0,1,2,0],[3,4,5,2],[1,3,1,5]]<br>
**Output:** [[0,0,0,0],[0,4,5,0],[0,3,1,0]]
 

**Constraints:**

- `m == matrix.length`
- `n == matrix[0].length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 200`
- `-2^31 <= matrix[i][j] <= 2^31 - 1`
 

**Follow up:**

- A straightforward solution using `O(mn)` space is probably a bad idea.
- A simple improvement uses `O(m + n)` space, but still not the best solution.
- Could you devise a constant space solution?

# Solution

The approach used in the given C++ solution is to:

1. Mark the rows and columns containing 0s in the first row and first column of the matrix respectively.
2. Traverse the matrix from the second row and second column and set all the elements in a row or column to 0 if the corresponding element in the first row or first column is 0.
3. Set the first row and first column to 0 if the corresponding element in the first row or first column is marked as 0.

The algorithm for the solution is as follows:

```c++
void setZeroes(vector<vector<int>>& matrix) {
  bool r, c;
  r = c = false;

  // Mark the rows and columns containing 0s in the first row and first column of the matrix respectively.
  for (int i = 0; i < matrix.size(); i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j < matrix[i].size(); j++) {
      if (matrix[i][j] == 0) {
        if (i == 0) r = true;
        if (j == 0) c = true;
        matrix[i][0] = 0;
        matrix[0][j] = 0;
      }
    }
  }

  // Traverse the matrix from the second row and second column and set all the elements in a row or column to 0 if the corresponding element in the first row or first column is 0.
  for (int i = 1; i < matrix.size(); i++) {
    for (int j = 1; j < matrix[i].size(); j++) {
      if (matrix[i][0] == 0 || matrix[0][j] == 0) {
        matrix[i][j] = 0;
      }
    }
  }

  // Set the first row and first column to 0 if the corresponding element in the first row or first column is marked as 0.
  if (r) {
    for (int i = 0; i < matrix[0].size(); i++) {
      matrix[0][i] = 0;
    }
  }
  if (c) {
    for (int i = 0; i < matrix.size(); i++) {
      matrix[i][0] = 0;
    }
  }
}
```

This solution is in-place and has a time complexity of O(m * n) and a space complexity of O(1).
