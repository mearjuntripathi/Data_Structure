# [48. Rotate Image](https://leetcode.com/problems/rotate-image/)

You are given an `n x n` 2D `matrix` representing an image, rotate the image by 90 degrees (clockwise).

You have to rotate the image [in-place](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm), which means you have to modify the input 2D matrix directly. DO NOT allocate another 2D matrix and do the rotation.

 


**Example 1:**

>**Input:** matrix = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]<br>
**Output:** [[7,4,1],[8,5,2],[9,6,3]]

**Example 2:**

>**Input:** matrix = [[5,1,9,11],[2,4,8,10],[13,3,6,7],[15,14,12,16]]<br>
**Output:** [[15,13,2,5],[14,3,4,1],[12,6,8,9],[16,7,10,11]]
 

**Constraints:**

- `n == matrix.length == matrix[i].length`
- `1 <= n <= 20`
- `-1000 <= matrix[i][j] <= 1000`

# Solution

The approach of this solution is to first transpose the matrix and then reverse each row. This will effectively rotate the matrix by 90 degrees clockwise.

The algorithm is as follows:

1. Iterate over the matrix, swapping the elements at (i, j) and (j, i) for all i and j less than the length of the matrix minus 1. This will transpose the matrix.
2. Iterate over the matrix again, reversing each row.

Here is a more detailed explanation of each step:

```c++
int n = matrix.size();
for(int i = 0; i < n-1 ; i++){
    for(int j = i+1 ; j < n ; j++){
        swap(matrix[i][j],matrix[j][i]);
    }
}
```

This loop iterates over the matrix, swapping the elements at (i, j) and (j, i) for all i and j less than the length of the matrix minus 1. This will transpose the matrix, meaning that the rows and columns of the matrix are swapped.

```c++
for(int i = 0 ;i < n ; i++)
    reverse(matrix[i].begin(), matrix[i].end());
```

This loop iterates over the matrix again, reversing each row. This will effectively rotate the matrix by 90 degrees clockwise, as shown in the following example:

```
Original matrix:
1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9

Transposed matrix:
1 4 7
2 5 8
3 6 9

Rotated matrix:
7 4 1
8 5 2
9 6 3
```

This solution is efficient, as it only requires two passes through the matrix. It is also easy to implement in C++.
