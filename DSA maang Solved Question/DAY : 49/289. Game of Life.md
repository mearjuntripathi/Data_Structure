# [289. Game of Life](https://leetcode.com/problems/game-of-life/)

According to Wikipedia's article: "**The Game of Life**, also known simply as **Life**, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970."

The board is made up of an `m x n` grid of cells, where each cell has an initial state: live (represented by a 1) or dead (represented by a `0`). Each cell interacts with its eight neighbors (horizontal, vertical, diagonal) using the following four rules (taken from the above Wikipedia article):

1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies as if caused by under-population.
1. Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
1. Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by over-population.
1. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

The next state is created by applying the above rules simultaneously to every cell in the current state, where births and deaths occur simultaneously. Given the current state of the `m x n` grid `board`, return the next state.

 


**Example 1:**

>**Input:** board = [[0,1,0],[0,0,1],[1,1,1],[0,0,0]]<br>
**Output:** [[0,0,0],[1,0,1],[0,1,1],[0,1,0]]

**Example 2:**

>**Input:** board = [[1,1],[1,0]]<br>
**Output:** [[1,1],[1,1]]
 

**Constraints:**

- `m == board.length`
- `n == board[i].length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 25`
- `board[i][j]` is `0` or `1`.
 

Follow up:

- Could you solve it in-place? Remember that the board needs to be updated simultaneously: You cannot update some cells first and then use their updated values to update other cells.
- In this question, we represent the board using a 2D array. In principle, the board is infinite, which would cause problems when the active area encroaches upon the border of the array (i.e., live cells reach the border). How would you address these problems?

# Solution

The approach taken in this C++ solution to Conway's Game of Life is to use a temporary grid to store the next state of the board. This allows us to avoid overwriting the current state of the board while we are calculating the next state.

The algorithm is as follows:

1. Iterate over the current state of the board, calculating the number of live neighbors for each cell.
2. For each cell, apply the following rules:
    * If the cell is live and has fewer than two live neighbors, it dies.
    * If the cell is live and has two or three live neighbors, it lives on to the next generation.
    * If the cell is live and has more than three live neighbors, it dies.
    * If the cell is dead and has exactly three live neighbors, it becomes a live cell.
3. Copy the temporary grid to the current state of the board.

The following is a more detailed explanation of each step:

**1. Calculate the number of live neighbors for each cell.**

To calculate the number of live neighbors for a cell, we iterate over the eight neighboring cells and count the number of cells that are alive. We can use the following code to do this:

```c++
int neighbors(vector<vector<int>> &board, const int &row, const int &col){
    int cnt = 0;
    cnt += row - 1 >= 0 && abs(board[row - 1][col]) == 1 ? 1 : 0;
    cnt += row + 1 < R && abs(board[row + 1][col]) == 1 ? 1 : 0;
    cnt += col - 1 >= 0 && abs(board[row][col - 1]) == 1 ? 1 : 0;
    cnt += col + 1 < C && abs(board[row][col + 1]) == 1 ? 1 : 0;
    cnt += row - 1 >= 0 && col - 1 >= 0 && abs(board[row - 1][col - 1]) == 1 ? 1 : 0;
    cnt += row - 1 >= 0 && col + 1 < C && abs(board[row - 1][col + 1]) == 1 ? 1 : 0;
    cnt += row + 1 < R && col - 1 >= 0 && abs(board[row + 1][col - 1]) == 1 ? 1 : 0;
    cnt += row + 1 < R && col + 1 < C && abs(board[row + 1][col + 1]) == 1 ? 1 : 0;
    
    return cnt;
}
```

**2. Apply the game of life rules to each cell.**

Once we have calculated the number of live neighbors for each cell, we can apply the game of life rules to each cell. The following code shows how to do this:

```c++
for(int i = 0 ; i < R ; i++){
    for(int j = 0 ; j < C ; j++){
        int neighbor = neighbors(board, i, j);
        if(board[i][j] == 0 && neighbor == 3)
            board[i][j] = -2;
        else if(board[i][j] && neighbor < 2)
            board[i][j] = -1;
        else if(board[i][j] && neighbor > 3)
            board[i][j] = -1;
    }
}
```

The `-1` and `-2` values represent the next state of the cell. If a cell is marked with a `-1` value, it will be dead in the next generation. If a cell is marked with a `-2` value, it will be alive in the next generation.

**3. Copy the temporary grid to the current state of the board.**

Once we have applied the game of life rules to each cell in the temporary grid, we can copy the temporary grid to the current state of the board. The following code shows how to do this:

```c++
for(int i = 0 ; i < R ; i++)
    for(int j = 0 ; j < C ; j++){
        if(board[i][j] == -1) board[i][j] = 0;
        else if(board[i][j] == -2) board[i][j] = 1;
    }
```

This completes one iteration of the game of life. We can repeat this process until we reach the desired number

```cpp
class Solution {
    int R,C;
    int neighbors(vector<vector<int>> &board, const int &row, const int &col){
        int cnt = 0;
        cnt += row - 1 >= 0 && abs(board[row - 1][col]) == 1 ? 1 : 0;
        cnt += row + 1 < R && abs(board[row + 1][col]) == 1 ? 1 : 0;
        cnt += col - 1 >= 0 && abs(board[row][col - 1]) == 1 ? 1 : 0;
        cnt += col + 1 < C && abs(board[row][col + 1]) == 1 ? 1 : 0;
        cnt += row - 1 >= 0 && col - 1 >= 0 && abs(board[row - 1][col - 1]) == 1 ? 1 : 0;
        cnt += row - 1 >= 0 && col + 1 < C && abs(board[row - 1][col + 1]) == 1 ? 1 : 0;
        cnt += row + 1 < R && col - 1 >= 0 && abs(board[row + 1][col - 1]) == 1 ? 1 : 0;
        cnt += row + 1 < R && col + 1 < C && abs(board[row + 1][col + 1]) == 1 ? 1 : 0;
        
        return cnt;
    }
public:
    void gameOfLife(vector<vector<int>>& board) {
        R = board.size();
        C= board[0].size();
        for(int i = 0 ; i < R ; i++){
            for(int j = 0 ; j < C ; j++){
                int neighbor = neighbors(board, i, j);
                if(board[i][j] == 0 && neighbor == 3)
                    board[i][j] = -2;
                else if(board[i][j] && neighbor < 2)
                    board[i][j] = -1;
                else if(board[i][j] && neighbor > 3)
                    board[i][j] = -1;
            }
        }
        for(int i = 0 ; i < R ; i++)
            for(int j = 0 ; j < C ; j++){
                if(board[i][j] == -1) board[i][j] = 0;
                else if(board[i][j] == -2) board[i][j] = 1;
            }
    }
};
