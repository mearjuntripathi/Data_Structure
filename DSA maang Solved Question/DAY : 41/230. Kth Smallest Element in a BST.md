>**Input:** root = [5,3,6,2,4,null,null,1], k = 3<br>
**Output:** 3
 

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the tree is n.
- `1 <= k <= n <= 1e4`
- `0 <= Node.val <= 1e4`

# Solution

The given C++ solution for the `kthSmallest` problem in a binary search tree (BST) uses the following approach and algorithm:

**Approach:**

The approach is to perform an in-order traversal of the BST and store the values of the nodes in a vector. The vector will be sorted in ascending order because of the in-order traversal. Once the vector is sorted, the `kthSmallest` element can be found by simply accessing the element at index `k-1` in the vector.

**Algorithm:**

The following algorithm shows how to find the `kthSmallest` element in a BST using the above approach:

```c++
int kthSmallest(TreeNode* root, int k) {
  // Create a vector to store the values of the nodes in the BST.
  vector<int> nodes;

  // Perform an in-order traversal of the BST and store the values of the nodes in the vector.
  inOrderTraversal(root, nodes);

  // Return the `kthSmallest` element in the vector.
  return nodes[k - 1];
}

void inOrderTraversal(TreeNode* root, vector<int>& nodes) {
  // If the root node is null, return.
  if (!root) {
    return;
  }

  // Perform an in-order traversal of the left subtree.
  inOrderTraversal(root->left, nodes);

  // Add the value of the root node to the vector.
  nodes.push_back(root->val);

  // Perform an in-order traversal of the right subtree.
  inOrderTraversal(root->right, nodes);
}
```

**Complexity analysis:**

The time complexity of the above algorithm is O(n), where `n` is the number of nodes in the BST. This is because the in-order traversal of a BST visits all of the nodes in the tree. The space complexity of the algorithm is O(n), since the vector needs to store all of the values of the nodes in the tree.

**Optimization:**

The above algorithm can be optimized by using a recursive algorithm to find the `kthSmallest` element in the BST. This can be done by maintaining a counter variable that keeps track of the number of nodes visited so far. When the counter variable reaches `k`, the algorithm returns the value of the current node.

The following algorithm shows how to find the `kthSmallest` element in a BST using a recursive algorithm:

```c++
    int kthSmallest(TreeNode* root, int &k) {
        int cnt = 0;
        int kthvalue;
        kthSmallest(root, cnt, kthvalue, k);
        return kthvalue;
    }
    
    void kthSmallest(TreeNode* root, int &cnt, int &ans, int k){
        if(!root) return;
        kthSmallest(root->left, cnt, ans, k);
        root->left = NULL;
        cnt++;
        if(cnt == k){
            ans = root->val;
            return;
        }
        kthSmallest(root->right, cnt, ans, k);
        root->right = NULL;
    }
```

The time complexity of the above recursive algorithm is still O(n), but the space complexity is reduced to O(1), since the algorithm does not need to store all of the values of the nodes in the tree.
