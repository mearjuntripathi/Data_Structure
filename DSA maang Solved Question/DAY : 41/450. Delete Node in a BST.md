# [450. Delete Node in a BST](https://leetcode.com/problems/delete-node-in-a-bst/)

Given a root node reference of a BST and a key, delete the node with the given key in the BST. Return the root node reference (possibly updated) of the BST.

Basically, the deletion can be divided into two stages:

1. Search for a node to remove.
2. If the node is found, delete the node.
 


**Example 1:**

>**Input:** root = [5,3,6,2,4,null,7], key = 3<br>
**Output:** [5,4,6,2,null,null,7]<br>
**Explanation:** Given key to delete is 3. So we find the node with value 3 and delete it.<br>
One valid answer is [5,4,6,2,null,null,7], shown in the above BST.<br>
Please notice that another valid answer is [5,2,6,null,4,null,7] and it's also accepted.

**Example 2:**

>**Input:** root = [5,3,6,2,4,null,7], key = 0<br>
**Output:** [5,3,6,2,4,null,7]<br>
**Explanation:** The tree does not contain a node with value = 0.

**Example 3:**

>**Input:** root = [], key = 0<br>
**Output:** []
 

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 104]`.
- `-1e5 <= Node.val <= 1e5`
- Each node has a unique value.
- `root` is a valid binary search tree.
- `-1e5 <= key <= 1e5`

# Solution

The approach used in the C++ solution for deleting a node from a binary search tree is:

1. **Find the node to be deleted.** This is done by traversing the tree recursively, comparing the key of the node to be deleted with the keys of the nodes in the tree. If the key of the node to be deleted is less than the key of the current node, then the search continues in the left subtree. If the key of the node to be deleted is greater than the key of the current node, then the search continues in the right subtree.
2. **Delete the node.** Once the node to be deleted has been found, it can be deleted from the tree. If the node has no children, then it can simply be deleted. If the node has one child, then the child can be substituted for the node. If the node has two children, then the inorder successor of the node can be substituted for the node. The inorder successor of a node is the smallest node in the right subtree of the node.
3. **Update the tree.** Once the node to be deleted has been deleted, the tree may need to be updated to maintain the binary search tree properties. For example, if the node to be deleted was the root node, then the new root node may need to be selected.

The following algorithm shows how to delete a node from a binary search tree in C++:

```c++
class Solution {

    void rightMost(TreeNode* root,TreeNode *rnode){
        while(root->right){
            root = root->right;
        }
        root->right = rnode;
    }

    void leftMost(TreeNode *root, TreeNode *lnode){
        while(root->left)
            root = root->left;
        
        root->left = lnode;
    }

    TreeNode* deleteNode(TreeNode *root){
        if(!root->left) return root->right;
        if(!root->right) return root->left;

        // arrenging a value from left node
/*
        TreeNode* leftnode = root->left;
        rightMost(root->left,root->right);
        delete(root);
        return leftnode;
*/
        // arrenging a value from right node
/*
        TreeNode* rightnode = root->right;
        leftMost(root->right,root->left);
        delete(root);
        return rightnode;
*/
    }
public:
    TreeNode* deleteNode(TreeNode* root, int key) {
        if(!root) return root;
        if(root->val == key) return deleteNode(root);

        TreeNode *dummy = root;
        while(dummy){
            if(dummy->val > key){
                if(dummy->left && dummy->left->val == key){
                    dummy->left = deleteNode(dummy->left);
                    break;
                }else dummy = dummy->left;
            }else{
                if(dummy->right && dummy->right->val == key){
                    dummy->right = deleteNode(dummy->right);
                    break;
                }else dummy = dummy->right;
            }
        }
        return root;
    }
};
```

This algorithm is recursive and time-efficient. It uses O(h) time to find the node to be deleted and O(h) time to delete the node, where h is the height of the tree. The algorithm also uses O(1) space.
