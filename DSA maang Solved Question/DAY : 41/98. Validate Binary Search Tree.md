# [98. Validate Binary Search Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/validate-binary-search-tree/)

Given the `root` of a binary tree, determine if it is a valid binary search tree (BST).

A valid BST is defined as follows:

- The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.
- The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.
- Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.
 


**Example 1:**

**Input:** root = [2,1,3]<br>
**Output:** true

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/12/01/tree2.jpg)

**Input:** root = [5,1,4,null,null,3,6]<br>
**Output:** false<br>
**Explanation:** The root node's value is 5 but its right child's value is 4.
 

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 104]`.
- `-2^31 <= Node.val <= 2^31 - 1`

# Solution

The approach used in this C++ solution to the Validate Binary Search Tree problem is to recursively check each node in the tree to make sure that it is greater than all the nodes in its left subtree and less than all the nodes in its right subtree.

The algorithm is as follows:

1. Define a recursive function `isValidBST()`, which takes four arguments:
    * `root`: The current node in the tree.
    * `leftBound`: The lower bound for the values of the nodes in the left subtree.
    * `rightBound`: The upper bound for the values of the nodes in the right subtree.
    * `validate`: A boolean flag that indicates whether the tree is valid up to this point.

2. If the current node is `NULL`, return.

3. If the value of the current node is greater than the left bound and less than the right bound, and the `validate` flag is still `true`, then:
    * Recursively call `isValidBST()` on the left subtree, passing in the current node's value as the new right bound.
    * Set the current node's left child to `NULL`.
    * If the `validate` flag is still `true`, then recursively call `isValidBST()` on the right subtree, passing in the current node's value as the new left bound.
    * Set the current node's right child to `NULL`.

4. Otherwise, set the `validate` flag to `false`.

5. Return.

In the `isValidBST()` function, the `validate` flag is used to track whether the tree is valid up to this point. If the flag is ever set to `false`, then the function immediately returns. This ensures that the entire tree is not traversed unnecessarily.

The main function of the program simply calls the `isValidBST()` function on the root node of the tree. If the `validate` flag is still `true` after the function returns, then the tree is valid. Otherwise, the tree is not valid.

Here is an example of how to use the algorithm:

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    bool isValidBST(TreeNode* root) {
        bool validate = true;
        isValidBST(root, LLONG_MIN, LLONG_MAX, validate);
        return validate;
    }

private:
    void isValidBST(TreeNode* root, long leftBound, long rightBound, bool &validate) {
        if (!root) {
            return;
        }

        if ((root->val > leftBound && root->val < rightBound) && validate) {
            isValidBST(root->left, leftBound, root->val, validate);
            root->left = NULL;
            if (validate) {
                isValidBST(root->right, root->val, rightBound, validate);
            }
            root->right = NULL;
        } else {
            validate = false;
        }
    }
};
```

To use the above code, you would simply create a new instance of the `Solution` class and call the `isValidBST()` function on the root node of the tree you want to validate. If the function returns `true`, then the tree is valid. Otherwise, the tree is not valid.
