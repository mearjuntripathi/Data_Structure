# [235. Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Search Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/lowest-common-ancestor-of-a-binary-search-tree/)

Given a binary search tree (BST), find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) node of two given nodes in the BST.

According to the [definition of LCA on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lowest_common_ancestor): “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes `p` and `q` as the lowest node in `T` that has both `p` and `q` as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).”

**Example 1:**

>**Input:** root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5], p = 2, q = 8<br>
**Output:** 6<br>
**Explanation:** The LCA of nodes 2 and 8 is 6.

**Example 2:**

>**Input:** root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5], p = 2, q = 4<br>
**Output:** 2<br>
**Explanation:** The LCA of nodes 2 and 4 is 2, since a node can be a descendant of itself according to the LCA definition.

**Example 3:**

>**Input:** root = [2,1], p = 2, q = 1<br>
**Output:** 2
 

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[2, 105]`.
- `-1e9 <= Node.val <= 1e9`
- All `Node.val` are unique.
- `p != q`
- `p` and `q` will exist in the BST.

# Solution

The approach used in this C++ solution to the lowest common ancestor problem is a recursive divide-and-conquer approach. The algorithm works as follows:

1. If the root node is null or is either of the two nodes, then return the root node.
2. Recursively call the algorithm on the left and right subtrees of the root node, passing in the two nodes as arguments.
3. If the left subtree contains one node and the right subtree contains the other node, then the lowest common ancestor is the root node.
4. Otherwise, the lowest common ancestor is the node that is returned by either the left or right subtree.

The algorithm is implemented in C++ as follows:

```c++
class Solution {
public:
  TreeNode* lowestCommonAncestor(TreeNode* root, TreeNode* p, TreeNode* q) {
    if (!root || root == p || root == q) {
      return root;
    }

    TreeNode* left = lowestCommonAncestor(root->left, p, q);
    TreeNode* right = lowestCommonAncestor(root->right, p, q);

    if (!left) {
      return right;
    }

    if (!right) {
      return left;
    }

    return root;
  }
};
```

This algorithm is time-efficient and space-efficient. It uses O(n) time to traverse the tree once and O(h) space to store the call stack, where h is the height of the tree.
