# [33. Search in Rotated Sorted Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/search-in-rotated-sorted-array/)

There is an integer array `nums` sorted in ascending order (with **distinct** values).

Prior to being passed to your function, `nums` is possibly rotated at an unknown pivot index `k` (`1 <= k < nums.length`) such that the resulting array is `[nums[k], nums[k+1], ..., nums[n-1], nums[0], nums[1], ..., nums[k-1]]` (**0-indexed**). For example, `[0,1,2,4,5,6,7]` might be rotated at pivot index `3` and become `[4,5,6,7,0,1,2]`.

Given the array `nums` after the possible rotation and an integer `target`, return the index of target if it is in `nums`, or `-1` if it is not in `nums`.

You must write an algorithm with `O(log n)` runtime complexity.

**Example 1:**

>**Input:** nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 0<br>
**Output:** 4

**Example 2:**

>**Input:** nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 3<br>
**Output:** -1

**Example 3:**

>**Input:** nums = [1], target = 0<br>
**Output:** -1
 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 5000`
- `-1e4 <= nums[i] <= 1e4`
- All values of `nums` are **unique**.
- `nums` is an ascending array that is possibly rotated.
- `-1e4 <= target <= 1e4`

# Solution

This C++ code represents an implementation of the "Search in Rotated Sorted Array" problem using a modified binary search algorithm. The problem involves finding a target element in a rotated sorted array.

Here is the approach and algorithm for this code:

### Approach:

The approach uses a modified binary search algorithm to find the target element in the rotated sorted array. The key idea is to determine whether the target lies in the left or right subarray of the mid element and adjust the search boundaries accordingly.

1. Initialize two pointers, `left` and `right`, to the first and last indices of the array, respectively.

2. Use a while loop to perform binary search until `left` is less than or equal to `right`.

3. Calculate the middle index `mid` as the average of `left` and `right`.

4. Check if the element at `mid` is equal to the target. If it is, set `position` to `mid` and break out of the loop.

5. If the element at `mid` is greater than or equal to the element at `left`, it means that the left subarray is sorted. In this case, check if the target lies within the left subarray (between `nums[left]` and `nums[mid]`). If it does, update `right` to `mid - 1` to search in the left subarray; otherwise, update `left` to `mid + 1` to search in the right subarray.

6. If the element at `mid` is less than the element at `left`, it means that the right subarray is sorted. In this case, check if the target lies within the right subarray (between `nums[mid]` and `nums[right]`). If it does, update `left` to `mid + 1` to search in the right subarray; otherwise, update `right` to `mid - 1` to search in the left subarray.

7. Repeat the above steps until the target is found, or the search boundaries overlap (indicating that the target is not in the array).

8. Return the `position` as the index of the target if found, or -1 if the target is not in the array.

### Algorithm:

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int search(vector<int>& nums, int target) {
        int position = -1;
        int left = 0;
        int right = nums.size() - 1;

        while (left <= right) {
            int mid = (left + right) / 2;

            if (nums[mid] == target) {
                position = mid;
                break;
            }

            if (nums[mid] >= nums[left]) {
                if (nums[left] <= target && nums[mid] >= target) {
                    right = mid - 1;
                } else {
                    left = mid + 1;
                }
            } else {
                if (nums[mid] <= target && nums[right] >= target) {
                    left = mid + 1;
                } else {
                    right = mid - 1;
                }
            }
        }
        return position;
    }
};
```

This algorithm efficiently searches for the target element in a rotated sorted array in O(log N) time complexity, where N is the number of elements in the input array.
