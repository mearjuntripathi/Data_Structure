# [981. Time Based Key-Value Store](https://leetcode.com/problems/time-based-key-value-store/)

Design a time-based key-value data structure that can store multiple values for the same key at different time stamps and retrieve the key's value at a certain timestamp.

Implement the `TimeMap` class:

- `TimeMap()` Initializes the object of the data structure.
- `void set(String key, String value, int timestamp)` Stores the key `key` with the value `value` at the given time `timestamp`.
- `String get(String key, int timestamp)` Returns a value such that set was called previously, with `timestamp_prev <= timestamp`. If there are multiple such values, it returns the value associated with the largest `timestamp_prev`. If there are no values, it returns `""`.
 

**Example 1:**

>**Input**<br>
["TimeMap", "set", "get", "get", "set", "get", "get"]<br>
[[], ["foo", "bar", 1], ["foo", 1], ["foo", 3], ["foo", "bar2", 4], ["foo", 4], ["foo", 5]]<br>
**Output**<br>
[null, null, "bar", "bar", null, "bar2", "bar2"]
>
>**Explanation**<br>
TimeMap timeMap = new TimeMap();<br>
timeMap.set("foo", "bar", 1);  // store the key "foo" and value "bar" along with timestamp = 1.<br>
timeMap.get("foo", 1);         // return "bar"<br>
timeMap.get("foo", 3);         // return "bar", since there is no value corresponding to foo at timestamp 3 and timestamp 2, then the only value is at timestamp 1 is "bar".<br>
timeMap.set("foo", "bar2", 4); // store the key "foo" and value "bar2" along with timestamp = 4.<br>
timeMap.get("foo", 4);         // return "bar2"<br>
timeMap.get("foo", 5);         // return "bar2"
 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= key.length, value.length <= 100`
- `key` and `value` consist of lowercase English letters and digits.
- `1 <= timestamp <= 1e7`
- All the timestamps `timestamp` of `set` are strictly increasing.
- At most `2 * 1e5` calls will be made to `set` and `get`.

# Solution

This C++ implementation of the TimeMap class uses an unordered_map to store the key-value pairs, where each key is associated with a vector of pairs, where each pair contains a value and a timestamp. The `get()` method uses a binary search to find the value that was associated with the given key at the given timestamp.

**Approach:**

1. Use an unordered_map to store the key-value pairs, where each key is associated with a vector of pairs, where each pair contains a value and a timestamp.
2. To set a value for a given key at a given timestamp, add a new pair to the vector of pairs associated with the given key, where the value is the given value and the timestamp is the given timestamp.
3. To get the value associated with a given key at a given timestamp, use a binary search to find the pair in the vector of pairs associated with the given key whose timestamp is less than or equal to the given timestamp. If such a pair exists, return the value of that pair. Otherwise, return an empty string.

**Algorithm:**

```c++
class TimeMap {
    unordered_map<string, vector<pair<string,int>>> timemap;
    string search(vector<pair<string,int>> &values, const int &timestamp){
        int low = 0;
        int high = values.size() - 1;

        while(low <= high){
            int mid = low + (high-low)/2;

            if(values[mid].second == timestamp) return values[mid].first;

            if(values[mid].second  < timestamp){
                low = mid + 1;
            }else{
                high = mid - 1;
            }
        }
        return high >= 0 ? values[high].first : "";
    }

public:
    TimeMap() {
    }
    
    void set(string key, string value, int timestamp) {
        timemap[key].push_back({value, timestamp});
    }
    
    string get(string key, int timestamp) {
        if(timemap.count(key)){
            return search(timemap[key], timestamp);
        }
        return "";
    }
};
```

This implementation of the TimeMap class is time-efficient and space-efficient. It uses O(1) time to set a value for a given key at a given timestamp and O(log n) time to get the value associated with a given key at a given timestamp, where n is the number of values associated with the given key. It also uses O(n) space to store the key-value pairs, where n is the total number of key-value pairs.
