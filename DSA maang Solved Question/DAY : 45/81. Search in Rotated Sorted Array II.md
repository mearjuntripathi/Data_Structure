# [81. Search in Rotated Sorted Array II](https://leetcode.com/problems/search-in-rotated-sorted-array-ii/)

There is an integer array `nums` sorted in non-decreasing order (not necessarily with **distinct** values).

Before being passed to your function, `nums` is rotated at an unknown pivot index k (`0 <= k < nums.length`) such that the resulting array is `[nums[k], nums[k+1], ..., nums[n-1], nums[0], nums[1], ..., nums[k-1]]` (**0-indexed**). For example, `[0,1,2,4,4,4,5,6,6,7]` might be rotated at pivot index `5` and become `[4,5,6,6,7,0,1,2,4,4]`.

Given the array nums after the rotation and an integer `target`, return `true` if target is in `nums`, or `false` if it is not in `nums`.

You must decrease the overall operation steps as much as possible.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = [2,5,6,0,0,1,2], target = 0<br>
**Output:** true

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = [2,5,6,0,0,1,2], target = 3<br>
**Output:** false
 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 5000`
- `-1e4` <= nums[i] <= `1e4`
- `nums` is guaranteed to be rotated at some pivot.
- `-1e4` <= target <= `1e4`
 

**Follow up:** This problem is similar to [Search in Rotated Sorted Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/search-in-rotated-sorted-array/description/), but nums may contain duplicates. Would this affect the runtime complexity? How and why?

# Solution

This C++ code represents an implementation of the "Search in Rotated Sorted Array II" problem, which is similar to the previous problem but allows for duplicates in the array. The goal is to determine whether a given target element is present in the rotated sorted array.

Here's the approach and algorithm for this code:

### Approach:

The approach uses a modified binary search algorithm, similar to the previous problem, but with additional considerations for handling duplicate elements.

1. Initialize two pointers, `left` and `right`, to the first and last indices of the array, respectively.

2. Use a while loop to perform binary search until `left` is less than or equal to `right`.

3. Calculate the middle index `mid` as the average of `left` and `right`.

4. Check if the element at `mid` is equal to the target. If it is, return `true` immediately, as the target is found.

5. If `nums[left]`, `nums[mid`, and `nums[right]` are all equal, it's unclear which subarray is sorted. In this case, you can increment `left` and decrement `right` to eliminate duplicates while preserving the possibility of finding the target in the remaining subarray.

6. If the element at `mid` is greater than or equal to the element at `left`, it means that the left subarray is sorted. In this case, check if the target lies within the left subarray (between `nums[left]` and `nums[mid]`). If it does, update `right` to `mid - 1` to search in the left subarray; otherwise, update `left` to `mid + 1` to search in the right subarray.

7. If the element at `mid` is less than the element at `left`, it means that the right subarray is sorted. In this case, check if the target lies within the right subarray (between `nums[mid]` and `nums[right]`). If it does, update `left` to `mid + 1` to search in the right subarray; otherwise, update `right` to `mid - 1` to search in the left subarray.

8. Repeat the above steps until the target is found, or the search boundaries overlap (indicating that the target is not in the array).

9. If the loop completes without finding the target, return `false` to indicate that the target is not in the array.

### Algorithm:

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool search(vector<int>& nums, int target) {
        int left = 0;
        int right = nums.size() - 1;

        while (left <= right) {
            int mid = (left + right) / 2;

            if (nums[mid] == target) {
                return true;
            }

            if (nums[left] == nums[mid] && nums[mid] == nums[right]) {
                left++;
                right--;
            } else if (nums[left] <= nums[mid]) {
                if (nums[left] <= target && target <= nums[mid]) {
                    right = mid - 1;
                } else {
                    left = mid + 1;
                }
            } else {
                if (nums[mid] <= target && target <= nums[right]) {
                    left = mid + 1;
                } else {
                    right = mid - 1;
                }
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
};
```

This algorithm efficiently searches for the target element in a rotated sorted array with duplicates in O(log N) time complexity, where N is the number of elements in the input array. It handles duplicate elements by incrementing `left` and decrementing `right` when `nums[left]`, `nums[mid`, and `nums[right]` are all equal, which ensures the correct search behavior.
