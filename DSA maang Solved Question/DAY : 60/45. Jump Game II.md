# [45. Jump Game II](https://leetcode.com/problems/jump-game-ii/)

You are given a 0-indexed array of integers `nums` of length `n`. You are initially positioned at `nums[0]`.

Each element `nums[i]` represents the maximum length of a forward jump from index i. In other words, if you are at `nums[i]`, you can jump to any `nums[i + j]` where:

- `0 <= j <= nums[i] and`
- `i + j < n`

Return the minimum number of jumps to reach `nums[n - 1]`. The test cases are generated such that you can reach `nums[n - 1]`.

**Example 1:**

>**Input:** nums = [2,3,1,1,4]<br>
**Output:** 2<br>
**Explanation:** The minimum number of jumps to reach the last index is 2. Jump 1 step from index 0 to 1, then 3 steps to the last index.

**Example 2:**

>**Input:** nums = [2,3,0,1,4]<br>
**Output:** 2
 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 1e4`
- `0 <= nums[i] <= 1000`
- It's guaranteed that you can reach `nums[n - 1]`.

# Solution

**Approach:**

The approach used in the given C++ solution to the jump problem is a greedy approach. The idea is to start from the first element in the array and greedily jump to the element that can reach the farthest. This process is repeated until the end of the array is reached.

**Algorithm:**

1. Initialize the following variables:
    * `jump`: The maximum index that can be reached from the current index.
    * `maxi`: The maximum index that has been reached so far.
    * `count`: The number of jumps taken.

2. Iterate over the array:
    * Update `jump` to be the maximum of `jump` and `i + nums[i]`.
    * If `i == maxi`:
        * Update `maxi` to be `jump`.
        * Increment `count`.
        * If `jump >= n - 1`:
            * Return `count`.

3. Return `count`.

**Example:**

Consider the following array:

```
nums = {1, 3, 5, 8, 9, 2, 6, 7, 6, 8, 9}
```

The algorithm would work as follows:

```
i = 0
jump = 1
maxi = 0
count = 0

i = 1
jump = 4
maxi = 0
count = 0

i = 2
jump = 9
maxi = 4
count = 1

i = 3
jump = 9
maxi = 9
count = 1

i = 4
jump = 9
maxi = 9
count = 1

i = 5
jump = 7
maxi = 9
count = 1

i = 6
jump = 12
maxi = 12
count = 2

i = 7
jump = 12
maxi = 12
count = 2

i = 8
jump = 12
maxi = 12
count = 2

i = 9
jump = 12
maxi = 12
count = 2

i = 10
jump = 12
maxi = 12
count = 2

```

The algorithm terminates at the end of the array because `jump >= n - 1`. Therefore, the minimum number of jumps required to reach the end of the array is `3`.

## Code

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int jump(vector<int>& nums) {
        if(nums.size() == 1 )
            return 0;
        int n = nums.size();
        int i = 0;
        int jump = 0;
        int maxi = 0;
        int count = 0;
        while(i < n){
            jump = max(jump , i + nums[i]);
            if(i == maxi){
                maxi = jump;
                count++;
                if(jump >= n-1)
                    return count;
            }
            i++;
        }
        return count;
    }
};
```

## Example

Consider the following array:

```
nums = [1, 3, 5, 8, 9, 2, 6, 7, 6, 8, 9]
```

The algorithm would work as follows:

1. Start at index 0.
2. Update the maximum reachable index `maxi` as follows:

```
maxi = max(maxi, 0 + nums[0]) = max(0, 1) = 1
```

3. Increment the number of jumps `count`.
4. Since the current index `i` is equal to the maximum reachable index `maxi`, a new jump is initiated.
5. The new maximum reachable index `maxi` is calculated as follows:

```
maxi = max(maxi, 1 + nums[1]) = max(1, 4) = 4
```

6. Increment the number of jumps `count`.
7. The new maximum reachable index `maxi` is calculated as follows:

```
maxi = max(maxi, 4 + nums[4]) = max(4, 9) = 9
```

8. Since the maximum reachable index `maxi` is greater than or equal to the size of the array, the end of the array has been reached and the algorithm terminates.

The total number of jumps required to reach the end of the array is 2.
