# [1143. Longest Common Subsequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-common-subsequence/)

Given two strings `text1` and `text2`, return the length of their longest common subsequence. If there is no common subsequence, return `0`.

A subsequence of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters (can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters.

For example, `"ace"` is a subsequence of `"abcde"`.
A common subsequence of two strings is a subsequence that is common to both strings.

**Example 1:**

>**Input:** text1 = "abcde", text2 = "ace" <br>
**Output:** 3  <br>
**Explanation:** The longest common subsequence is "ace" and its length is 3.

**Example 2:**

>**Input:** text1 = "abc", text2 = "abc"<br>
**Output:** 3<br>
**Explanation:** The longest common subsequence is "abc" and its length is 3.

**Example 3:**

>**Input:** text1 = "abc", text2 = "def"<br>
**Output:** 0<br>
**Explanation:** There is no such common subsequence, so the result is 0.
 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= text1.length, text2.length <= 1000`
- `text1` and `text2` consist of only lowercase English characters.

# Solution

Sure, here is an explanation of the approach and algorithm for the solution in C++:

**Approach:**

The longest common subsequence (LCS) problem is to find the longest subsequence that is common to two strings. A subsequence is a sequence that appears in the same relative order, but not necessarily contiguous. For example, "abc" is a subsequence of "abcdefg", but "acb" is not.

The LCS problem can be solved using dynamic programming. Dynamic programming is a technique for solving problems by breaking them down into smaller subproblems and storing the solutions to these subproblems to avoid recomputing them.

**Algorithm:**

The algorithm for solving the LCS problem using dynamic programming is as follows:

1. Create a table `dp` with dimensions `m x n`, where `m` is the length of the first string and `n` is the length of the second string.

2. Initialize all cells in the table to `0`.

3. Fill the table in a bottom-up manner, starting from the bottom-right cell and working your way up to the top-left cell.

4. For each cell, consider the following two cases:

    a. If the characters at the corresponding indices in the two strings are equal, then the LCS length for the current cell is 1 plus the LCS length for the cell below it on the right.

    b. If the characters at the corresponding indices in the two strings are not equal, then the LCS length for the current cell is the maximum of the LCS lengths for the cell below it and the cell to the right of it.

5. The LCS length for the top-left cell of the table is the length of the longest common subsequence of the two strings.

**C++ Implementation:**

The C++ implementation of the algorithm is as follows:

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int longestCommonSubsequence(string text1, string text2) {
        vector<vector<int>> dp(text1.length()+1, vector<int>(text2.length()+1, 0));
        for(int i = text1.length()-1 ; i >= 0 ; i--){
            for(int j = text2.length()-1 ; j >= 0 ; j--){
                int ans;
                if(text1[i] == text2[j])
                    ans = 1+dp[i+1][j+1];
                else
                    ans = max(dp[i][j+1], dp[i+1][j]);
                dp[i][j] = ans;
            }
        }
        return dp[0][0];
    }
};
```

This code first creates a table `dp` with dimensions `m x n`, where `m` is the length of the first string and `n` is the length of the second string. Then, it initializes all cells in the table to `0`. Next, it fills the table in a bottom-up manner, starting from the bottom-right cell and working its way up to the top-left cell. For each cell, it considers the following two cases:

* If the characters at the corresponding indices in the two strings are equal, then the LCS length for the current cell is 1 plus the LCS length for the cell below it on the right.

* If the characters at the corresponding indices in the two strings are not equal, then the LCS length for the current cell is the maximum of the LCS lengths for the cell below it and the cell to the right of it.

Finally, the code returns the LCS length for the top-left cell of the table, which is the length of the longest common subsequence of the two strings.
