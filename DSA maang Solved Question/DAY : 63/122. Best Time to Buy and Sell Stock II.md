# [122. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock II](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock-ii/)

You are given an integer array prices where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `ith` day.

On each day, you may decide to buy and/or sell the stock. You can only hold at most one share of the stock at any time. However, you can buy it then immediately sell it on the same day.

Find and return the maximum profit you can achieve.

 


**Example 1:**

>**Input:** prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]<br>
**Output:** 7<br>
**Explanation:** Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 3 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.<br>
Then buy on day 4 (price = 3) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-3 = 3.<br>
Total profit is 4 + 3 = 7.

**Example 2:**

>**Input:** prices = [1,2,3,4,5]<br>
**Output:** 4<br>
**Explanation:** Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.<br>
Total profit is 4.

**Example 3:**

>**Input:** prices = [7,6,4,3,1]<br>
**Output:** 0<br>
**Explanation:** There is no way to make a positive profit, so we never buy the stock to achieve the maximum profit of 0.
 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= prices.length <= 3 * 1e4`
- `0 <= prices[i] <= 1e4`

# Solution

Here is an approach and algorithm for the solution in C++:

**Approach:**

The algorithm iterates through the prices vector and compares each price to the previous price. If the current price is greater than the previous price, then the difference between the two prices is added to the profit variable. The algorithm returns the profit variable at the end.

**Algorithm:**

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices) {
        int profit = 0;
        int prevStock = prices [0];
        int n = prices.size();
        for(int i = 1 ; i < n ; i++){
            if(prevStock < prices[i]){
                profit += prices[i] - prevStock;
            }
            prevStock = prices[i];
        }
        return profit;
    }
};
```

**Explanation:**

The `maxProfit()` function takes a vector of integers `prices` as input. The function initializes three variables: `profit`, `prevStock`, and `n`. The `profit` variable is used to store the maximum profit, the `prevStock` variable is used to store the previous stock price, and the `n` variable is used to store the size of the `prices` vector.

The function then iterates through the `prices` vector, starting from the second element (index 1). For each element, the function compares the current price to the previous price. If the current price is greater than the previous price, then the difference between the two prices is added to the `profit` variable. The `prevStock` variable is then updated to the current price.

Finally, the function returns the `profit` variable.

**Complexity:**

The time complexity of the algorithm is O(n), where n is the size of the `prices` vector. This is because the algorithm iterates through the `prices` vector once. The space complexity of the algorithm is O(1), since it only uses a constant amount of memory.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
