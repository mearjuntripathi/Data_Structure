# [64. Minimum Path Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-path-sum/)

Given a `m x n` grid filled with non-negative numbers, find a path from top left to bottom right, which minimizes the sum of all numbers along its path.

**Note:** You can only move either down or right at any point in time.

**Example 1:**

>**Input:** grid = [[1,3,1],[1,5,1],[4,2,1]]<br>
**Output:** 7<br>
**Explanation:** Because the path 1 → 3 → 1 → 1 → 1 minimizes the sum.

**Example 2:**

>**Input:** grid = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6]]<br>
**Output:** 12
 

**Constraints:**

- `m == grid.length`
- `n == grid[i].length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 200`
- `0 <= grid[i][j] <= 200`

# Solution

**Approach:**

The `minPathSum` function takes a 2D vector `grid` of integers as input and returns the minimum path sum from the top-left corner of the grid to the bottom-right corner. The function uses a dynamic programming approach to compute the minimum path sum.

**Algorithm:**

1. Create a 2D vector `dp` of the same size as the `grid` to store the minimum path sums for each cell.

2. Initialize all cells of the `dp` vector to `-1`.

3. Define a recursive function `pathSUM` that takes three parameters:
    - `i`: The row index of the current cell.
    - `j`: The column index of the current cell.
    - `grid`: The 2D vector of integers.
    - `dp`: The 2D vector of minimum path sums.
4. The `pathSUM` function returns the minimum path sum from the current cell to the bottom-right corner of the grid. The base cases of the function are:
    - If `i` is less than `0` or `j` is less than `0`, then the function returns `INT_MAX`.
    - If `i` is equal to `0` and `j` is equal to `0`, then the function returns the value of the cell `grid[0][0]`.
5. Otherwise, the function computes the minimum path sums from the top and left cells of the current cell using the recursive function `pathSUM`. The minimum of these two path sums plus the value of the current cell is then returned as the minimum path sum from the current cell.
6. The `minPathSum` function calls the `pathSUM` function to compute the minimum path sum from the top-left corner of the grid to the bottom-right corner and returns the result.

**Here is the C++ code for the `minPathSum` function:**

```c++
class Solution {
    int row, col;
    int pathSUM(int i, int j, vector<vector<int>> &grid, vector<vector<int>> &dp){
        if(i<0 || j<0) return INT_MAX;
        if(i==0 && j==0) return grid[0][0];
        if(dp[i][j]!=-1) return dp[i][j];
        int top = pathSUM(i-1,j,grid,dp);
        int left = pathSUM(i,j-1,grid,dp);
        return dp[i][j]=min(left,top)+grid[i][j];
    }
 public:
    int minPathSum(vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
        int n = grid.size();
        int m = grid[0].size();
        vector<vector<int>>dp(n,vector<int>(m,-1));
        return pathSUM(n-1,m-1,grid,dp);
    }
};
```

**Complexity:**

The time complexity of the `minPathSum` function is `O(n*m)`, where `n` is the number of rows in the `grid` and `m` is the number of columns in the `grid`. The space complexity of the function is also `O(n*m)`, due to the use of the `dp` vector.
