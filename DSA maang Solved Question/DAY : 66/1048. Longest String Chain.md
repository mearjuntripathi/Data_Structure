# [1048. Longest String Chain](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-string-chain/)

You are given an array of words where each word consists of lowercase English letters.

`wordA` is a predecessor of `wordB` if and only if we can insert exactly one letter anywhere in `wordA` without changing the order of the other characters to make it equal to `wordB`.

For example, `"abc"` is a predecessor of `"abac"`, while `"cba"` is not a predecessor of `"bcad"`.
A word chain is a sequence of words `[word1, word2, ..., wordk]` with `k >= 1`, where word1 is a predecessor of `word2`, `word2` is a predecessor of word3, and so on. A single word is trivially a word chain with `k == 1`.

Return the length of the longest possible word chain with words chosen from the given list of `words`.

**Example 1:**

>**Input:** words = ["a","b","ba","bca","bda","bdca"]<br>
**Output:** 4<br>
**Explanation:** One of the longest word chains is ["a","ba","bda","bdca"].

**Example 2:**

>**Input:** words = ["xbc","pcxbcf","xb","cxbc","pcxbc"]<br>
**Output:** 5<br>
**Explanation:** All the words can be put in a word chain ["xb", "xbc", "cxbc", "pcxbc", "pcxbcf"].

**Example 3:**

>**Input:** words = ["abcd","dbqca"]<br>
**Output:** 1<br>
**Explanation:** The trivial word chain ["abcd"] is one of the longest word chains.<br>
["abcd","dbqca"] is not a valid word chain because the ordering of the letters is changed.
 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= words.length <= 1000`
- `1 <= words[i].length <= 16`
- `words[i]` only consists of lowercase English letters.

# Solution
Sure, here is an approach and algorithm for the solution in C++:

**Approach:**

The problem can be solved using a dynamic programming approach. The idea is to maintain a map for each string length, where the key is the string and the value is the longest string chain that can be formed with that string as the starting string.

**Algorithm:**

1. Sort the `words` vector in ascending order by string length.
2. Initialize a map for each string length.
3. Iterate over the `words` vector.
4. For each word, iterate over all of its substrings.
5. If a substring is found in the map for the previous string length, then update the longest string chain for the current word.
6. Update the longest string chain for the current word in the map for the current string length.
7. Return the maximum longest string chain from all of the maps.

Here is the C++ code for the solution:

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int longestStrChain(vector<string>& words) {
        int n = words.size();
        if(n == 1)
            return 1;
        
        sort(words.begin(), words.end(), [&](string x, string y){return x.size() < y.size();});

        vector<unordered_map<string, int>> mp(17);

        for(auto &word : words){
            mp[word.size()][word] = 1;
        }

        int chain = 0;

        for(auto &word : words){
            int size = word.size();
            if(size == 1) continue;

            for(int i = 0 ; i < size ; i++){
                string temp_word = word.substr(0,i) + word.substr(i+1);
                if(mp[size-1].find(temp_word) != mp[size-1].end())
                    mp[size][word] = max(mp[size][word], mp[size-1][temp_word] + 1);
            }
            chain = max(chain, mp[size][word]);
        }
        return chain;
    }
};
```

This solution works by iteratively building up the longest string chain for each word. For each word, the algorithm iterates over all of its substrings and checks if any of those substrings are in the map for the previous string length. If they are, then the longest string chain for the current word is updated to be one greater than the longest string chain for the substring.

The algorithm also keeps track of the maximum longest string chain from all of the maps. This is the final value that is returned by the algorithm.

I hope this helps!
