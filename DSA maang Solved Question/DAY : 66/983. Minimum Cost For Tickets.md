# [983. Minimum Cost For Tickets](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-cost-for-tickets/)

You have planned some train traveling one year in advance. The days of the year in which you will travel are given as an integer array `days`. Each day is an integer from `1` to `365`.

Train tickets are sold in three different ways:

- a 1-day pass is sold for costs[0] dollars,
- a 7-day pass is sold for costs[1] dollars, and
- a 30-day pass is sold for costs[2] dollars.

The passes allow that many days of consecutive travel.

- For example, if we get a 7-day pass on day `2`, then we can travel for `7` days: `2`, `3`, `4`, `5`, `6`, `7`, and `8`.

Return the minimum number of dollars you need to travel every day in the given list of days.


**Example 1:**

>**Input:** days = [1,4,6,7,8,20], costs = [2,7,15]<br>
**Output:** 11<br>
**Explanation:** For example, here is one way to buy passes that lets you travel your travel plan:<br>
On day 1, you bought a 1-day pass for costs[0] = $2, which covered day 1.
On day 3, you bought a 7-day pass for costs[1] = $7, which covered days 3,4, ..., 9.<br> 
On day 20, you bought a 1-day pass for costs[0] = $2, which covered day 20.
In total, you spent $11 and covered all the days of your travel.

**Example 2:**

>**Input:** days = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,30,31], costs = [2,7,15]<br>
**Output:** 17<br>
**Explanation:** For example, here is one way to buy passes that lets you travel your travel plan:<br>
On day 1, you bought a 30-day pass for costs[2] = $15 which covered days 1, 2, ..., 30.<br>
On day 31, you bought a 1-day pass for costs[0] = $2 which covered day 31.
In total, you spent $17 and covered all the days of your travel.
 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= days.length <= 365`
- `1 <= days[i] <= 365`
- `days` is in strictly increasing order.
- `costs.length == 3`
- `1 <= costs[i] <= 1000`

# Solution
Certainly! Let's break down the approach and algorithm for the given C++ solution.

### Approach:

The goal of the problem is to find the minimum cost to cover all the days given a set of rules for buying tickets. The dynamic programming approach is used to calculate the minimum cost for each day by considering the costs of buying tickets on the current day, 7 days later, and 30 days later.

### Algorithm:

1. Find the last day of travel as it helps in determining the size of the dynamic programming array.
2. Create a dynamic programming array `dp` with a size of `lastDay + 2`, initialized to -1.
3. Set `dp[lastDay + 1]` to 0 since there is no cost after the last day.
4. Set the values in `dp` corresponding to the travel days to 0, as no cost is incurred on those days initially.
5. Iterate through the days in reverse order, from `lastDay` to 0.
   - If `dp[i]` is -1 (indicating no travel on that day), set it to the value of `dp[i+1]`.
   - If `dp[i]` is not -1 (indicating travel on that day):
     - Calculate the cost of buying a 1-day pass on the current day and update `dp[i]`.
     - Calculate the cost of buying a 7-day pass starting from the current day and update `dp[i]`.
     - Calculate the cost of buying a 30-day pass starting from the current day and update `dp[i]`.
     - Choose the minimum cost among the three options.
6. Return the minimum cost calculated for the first day (`dp[0]`).

### Code Explanation:

```cpp
int mincostTickets(vector<int>& days, vector<int>& costs) {
  // Step 1
  int lastDay = *max_element(days.begin(), days.end());
  
  // Step 2
  vector<int> dp(lastDay + 2, -1);

  // Step 3
  dp[lastDay + 1] = 0;

  // Step 4
  for (auto day : days) dp[day] = 0;

  // Step 5
  for (int i = lastDay; i >= 0; i--) {
    if (dp[i] == -1)
      dp[i] = dp[i + 1];
    else {
      dp[i] = dp[min(i + 1, lastDay + 1)] + costs[0];
      dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[min(i + 7, lastDay + 1)] + costs[1]);
      dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[min(i + 30, lastDay + 1)] + costs[2]);
    }
  }

  // Step 6
  return dp[0];
}
```

This code efficiently calculates the minimum cost using dynamic programming for the given set of travel days and ticket costs.
