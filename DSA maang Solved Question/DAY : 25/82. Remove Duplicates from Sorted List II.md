# [82. Remove Duplicates from Sorted List II](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-duplicates-from-sorted-list-ii/)

Given the head of a sorted linked list, delete all nodes that have duplicate numbers, leaving only distinct numbers from the original list. Return the linked list sorted as well.

 


**Example 1:**

>**Input:** head = [1,2,3,3,4,4,5]<br>
**Output:** [1,2,5]

**Example 2:**

>**Input:** head = [1,1,1,2,3]<br>
**Output:** [2,3]
 

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the list is in the range `[0, 300]`.
- `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`
- The list is guaranteed to be sorted in ascending order.

# Solution

**Approach:**
The approach used in this code is to traverse a singly-linked list while maintaining three pointers: `curr`, `prev`, and `last`. It identifies and removes duplicate elements from the list while keeping only the distinct ones. The algorithm uses a boolean variable `duplicate` to track whether the current value is a duplicate of the previous value.

**Algorithm:**
1. Initialize three pointers: `curr`, `prev`, and `last`.
2. Traverse the linked list using a `while` loop.
3. If `prev` is `NULL`, it's the first element, so assign `prev` to `curr`.
4. Check if the current node's value is the same as the previous node's value or if `duplicate` is true.
5. If it's a duplicate, update `duplicate`, replace the previous node's value with the current node's value, and remove the current node.
6. If it's not a duplicate, insert the current node into the non-duplicate list.
7. After the loop, check if the last node was a duplicate. If it is, remove it.
8. Return the modified head of the list.


```cpp
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * struct ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode *next;
 *     ListNode() : val(0), next(nullptr) {}
 *     ListNode(int x) : val(x), next(nullptr) {}
 *     ListNode(int x, ListNode *next) : val(x), next(next) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    ListNode* deleteDuplicates(ListNode* head) {
        bool duplicate = false;
        ListNode *curr = head;
        ListNode *prev = nullptr;
        ListNode *last = nullptr;

        while (curr) {
            // If prev is null, insert value in it
            if (!prev) {
                prev = curr;
                curr = curr->next;
                continue;
            }
            
            // Check if current value matches the previous value or if duplicate is true
            if (curr->val == prev->val || duplicate) {
                // Check if the current value is not a match, but previous value is not distinct
                duplicate = (curr->val != prev->val) ? false : true;

                // Replace previous value with current value
                prev->val = curr->val;
                prev->next = curr->next;
                
                // Delete the current node
                delete curr;
            } else {
                // If previous value is distinct, insert the current value in the previous node's next
                prev->next = curr;

                // Keep track of the last non-duplicate node from the end
                last = prev;

                // Move to the next node
                prev = prev->next;
            }

            // Move curr to the next node
            curr = prev->next;
        }

        // If the last node is a duplicate, use last
        if (duplicate) {
            // If last is null, all values were duplicates, so return NULL
            if (!last) return last;

            // Otherwise, the last element is a duplicate
            last->next = nullptr;

            // Delete the last duplicate node
            delete prev;
        }

        // Return the head of the modified list
        return head;
    }
};

```

**Time Complexity:**
- The code traverses the entire linked list once, which takes O(n) time, where n is the number of nodes in the list.
- The operations performed within the loop, such as comparing values, updating pointers, and deleting nodes, all have constant time complexity.
- Therefore, the overall time complexity is O(n).

**Space Complexity:**
- The code uses a constant amount of extra space for three pointers (`curr`, `prev`, `last`) and a boolean variable `duplicate`.
- No additional data structures are used that depend on the input size.
- Thus, the space complexity is O(1), indicating constant space usage.

**About the Code:**
- The code provides a solution to the problem of removing duplicates from a singly-linked list while preserving the order of distinct elements.
- It is implemented in C++ and follows a clear and structured approach.
- The code handles edge cases, such as the first node being a duplicate or the last node being a duplicate.
- It uses dynamic memory allocation (`delete`) to remove duplicate nodes.
- The linked list structure is defined using the `ListNode` struct, and the function `deleteDuplicates` modifies the input list in-place.
- Overall, the code is efficient and follows good programming practices for working with linked lists in C++.
