# [237. Delete Node in a Linked List](https://leetcode.com/problems/delete-node-in-a-linked-list/)

There is a singly-linked list `head` and we want to delete a node `node` in it.

You are given the node to be deleted `node`. You will not be given access to the first node of `head`.

All the values of the linked list are **unique**, and it is guaranteed that the given node `node` is not the last node in the linked list.

Delete the given node. Note that by deleting the node, we do not mean removing it from memory. We mean:

- The value of the given node should not exist in the linked list.
- The number of nodes in the linked list should decrease by one.
- All the values before `node` should be in the same order.
- All the values after `node` should be in the same order.

**Custom testing:**

- For the input, you should provide the entire linked list `head` and the node to be given `node`. `node` should not be the last node of the list and should be an actual node in the list.
- We will build the linked list and pass the node to your function.
- The output will be the entire list after calling your function.
 


**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/09/01/node1.jpg)

>**Input:** head = [4,5,1,9], node = 5<br>
**Output:** [4,1,9]<br>
**Explanation:** You are given the second node with value 5, the linked list should become 4 -> 1 -> 9 after calling your function.

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/09/01/node2.jpg)

>**Input:** head = [4,5,1,9], node = 1<br>
**Output:** [4,5,9]<br>
**Explanation:** You are given the third node with value 1, the linked list should become 4 -> 5 -> 9 after calling your function.
 

**Constraints:**

- The number of the nodes in the given list is in the range `[2, 1000]`.
- `-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000`
- The value of each node in the list is **unique**.
- The `node` to be deleted is **in the list** and is **not a tail** node.

# Solution

The solution you provided has two approaches:

**Approach 1:**

1. Iterate over the linked list, starting from the node to be deleted.
2. For each node, copy the value of the next node to the current node.
3. If the next node is the last node in the linked list, set the next pointer of the current node to NULL.
4. Delete the next node in the linked list.

**Algorithm:**

```c++
void Solution::deleteNode(ListNode* node) {
  ListNode* curr = node;
  ListNode* next = node->next;
  while (curr && next) {
    curr->val = next->val;
    if (!next->next) {
      curr->next = NULL;
      break;
    }
    curr = curr->next;
    next = next->next;
  }
  delete next;
}
```

**Approach 2:**

1. Create a temporary pointer to the next node in the linked list.
2. Copy the value of the next node to the current node.
3. Set the next pointer of the current node to the next pointer of the next node.
4. Delete the temporary pointer.

**Algorithm:**

```c++
void Solution::deleteNode(ListNode* node) {
  ListNode* temp = node->next;
  node->val = temp->val;
  node->next = temp->next;
  delete temp;
}
```

Which approach to use depends on the specific requirements of the problem. If space is a constraint, then Approach 2 is a good choice. However, if time is a constraint, then Approach 1 may be a better choice.

**Example:**

```c++
ListNode* head = new ListNode(1);
head->next = new ListNode(2);
head->next->next = new ListNode(3);

Solution sol;
sol.deleteNode(head->next); // Delete the node with value 2.

// The linked list is now: 1 -> 3
```
