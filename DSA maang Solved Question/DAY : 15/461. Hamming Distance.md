# [461. Hamming Distance](https://leetcode.com/problems/hamming-distance/)

The Hamming distance between two integers is the number of positions at which the corresponding bits are different.

Given two integers x and y, return the Hamming distance between them.

 

**Example 1:**

> **Input:** x = 1, y = 4<br>
**Output:** 2<br>
**Explanation:**<br>
1   (0 0 0 1)<br>
4   (0 1 0 0)<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ↑ &nbsp; &nbsp; ↑<br>
The above arrows point to positions where the corresponding bits are different.

**Example 2:**

> **Input:** x = 3, y = 1<br>
**Output:** 1

**Constraints:**

- `0 <= x, y <= 231 - 1`

# Solution

The approach of the code is to use the bitwise XOR (`^`) operator to calculate the difference between the two input integers `x` and `y`. The bitwise XOR operator sets to 1 only the bits that are different in the two input integers.

The algorithm of the code is as follows:

1. Initialize a variable `dist` to zero.
2. Calculate the bitwise XOR of `x` and `y` and store the result in `val`.
3. While `val` is greater than zero:
    * Increment `dist`.
    * Clear the least significant bit of `val` using the bitwise AND (`&`) operator and the bitwise NOT (`~`) operator.
4. Return `dist`.

The following is a more detailed explanation of the algorithm:

```c++
int hammingDistance(int x, int y) {
        int dist = 0;

        // The ^ operators sets to 1 only the bits that are different
        for (int val = x ^ y; val > 0; ++dist)
        {
            // We then count the bit set to 1 using the Peter Wegner way
            val = val & (val - 1); // Set to zero val's lowest-order 1
        }

        // Return the number of differing bits
        return dist;
    }
```

* The `val = x ^ y` line calculates the bitwise XOR of `x` and `y` and stores the result in `val`.
* The `while (val > 0)` loop iterates over the bits in `val` and counts the number of bits that are set to 1.
* The `dist += 1` line increments the `dist` variable by one.
* The `val = val & (val - 1)` line clears the least significant bit of `val`. This is done by performing a bitwise AND operation between `val` and `val - 1`. The bitwise AND operation sets to 1 only the bits that are set to 1 in both input integers. Since `val - 1` has the least significant bit cleared, the bitwise AND operation will clear the least significant bit of `val`.
* The `return dist` line returns the `dist` variable, which contains the number of bits that are different between `x` and `y`.

Here is an example of how to use the `hammingDistance()` function:

```c++
int main() {
    int x = 10;
    int y = 15;

    int hamming_distance = hammingDistance(x, y);

    printf("The Hamming distance between %d and %d is %d.\n", x, y, hamming_distance);

    return 0;
}
```

Output:

```
The Hamming distance between 10 and 15 is 2.
```
