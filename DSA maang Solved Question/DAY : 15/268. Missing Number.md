# [268. Missing Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/missing-number/)
Given an array nums containing `n` distinct numbers in the range `[0, n]`, return the only number in the range that is missing from the array.

**Example 1:**

> **Input:** nums = [3,0,1]<br>
**Output:** 2<br>
**Explanation:** n = 3 since there are 3 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,3]. 2 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.

**Example 2:**

> **Input:** nums = [0,1]<br>
**Output:** 2<br>
**Explanation:** n = 2 since there are 2 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,2]. 2 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.

**Example 3:**

> **Input:** nums = [9,6,4,2,3,5,7,0,1]<br>
**Output:** 8<br>
**Explanation:** n = 9 since there are 9 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,9]. 8 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.
 

**Constraints:**

- `n == nums.length`
- `1 <= n <= 104`
- `0 <= nums[i] <= n`
- **All the numbers of `nums` are unique**.

# Solution

The code I provided has three approaches for finding the missing number in a sorted array of integers:

**Mathematical approach**

This approach uses the following formula to calculate the sum of all the integers in the array from 1 to the length of the array:

```
sum = (n * (n + 1)) / 2
```

where `n` is the length of the array.

The code then subtracts the sum of all the integers in the array from the calculated sum to find the missing number.

```c++
int missingNumber(vector<int>& nums) {
    // Mathmatical approach
    int all_sum = (nums.size() * (nums.size()+1))/2;
    for(auto num : nums)
        all_sum -= num;

    return all_sum;
}
```

**Bit manipulation approach**

This approach uses the following bitwise operations to find the missing number:

```cpp
int missingNumber(vector<int>& nums) {
    numxor = nums[0]
    valuexor = 0^nums.size()
    for(int i = 1 ;i < nums.size() ; i++){
        numxor ^= nums[i];
        valuexor ^= i;
    }
    return numxor ^ valuexor;
}
```

The `numxor` variable stores the XOR of all the integers in the array. The `valuexor` variable stores the XOR of all the integers from 1 to the length of the array.

The missing number is the XOR of `numxor` and `valuexor`.

**Sorting approach**

This approach sorts the array in ascending order and then iterates over the array to find the missing number. The missing number is the first integer in the array that is not equal to its index.

```c++
int missingNumber(vector<int>& nums) {
    // sorting approach
    sort(nums.begin(),nums.end());
    for(int i=0;i<nums.size();i++){
        if(nums[i] != i)
            return i;
    }
    return nums.size();
}
```

**Algorithm**

The algorithm for finding the missing number in a sorted array of integers is as follows:

1. Choose one of the three approaches described above.
2. Implement the chosen approach in a programming language of your choice.
3. Test the implementation on a variety of input arrays to ensure that it is correct.

**Example**

```c++
int main() {
    vector<int> nums = {0, 1, 2, 3, 5};

    int missing_number = missingNumber(nums);

    cout << "The missing number is: " << missing_number << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

Output:

```
The missing number is: 4
```
