# [190. Reverse Bits](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-bits/)

Reverse bits of a given 32 bits unsigned integer.

**Note:**

- Note that in some languages, such as Java, there is no unsigned integer type. In this case, both input and output will be given as a signed integer type. They should not affect your implementation, as the integer's internal binary representation is the same, whether it is signed or unsigned.
- In Java, the compiler represents the signed integers using [2's complement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two%27s_complement) notation. Therefore, in Example 2 above, the input represents the signed integer `-3` and the output represents the signed integer `-1073741825`.
 

**Example 1:**

> **Input:** n = 00000010100101000001111010011100<br>
**Output:**    964176192 (00111001011110000010100101000000)<br>
**Explanation:** The input binary string 00000010100101000001111010011100 represents the unsigned integer 43261596, so return 964176192 which its binary representation is 00111001011110000010100101000000.

**Example 2:**

> **Input:** n = 11111111111111111111111111111101<br>
**Output:**   3221225471 (10111111111111111111111111111111)<br>
**Explanation:** The input binary string 11111111111111111111111111111101 represents the unsigned integer 4294967293, so return 3221225471 which its binary representation is 10111111111111111111111111111111.
 

**Constraints:**

- The input must be a **binary string** of length `32`

# Solution

The approach of the code is to reverse the bits of an unsigned 32-bit integer using a bitwise shift and XOR operation.

The algorithm of the code is as follows:

1. Initialize a variable `res` to store the reversed integer.
2. Iterate over the bits of the input integer `n`:
    * Shift the `res` variable to the left by one bit.
    * If the least significant bit of `n` is set, then XOR the `res` variable with 1.
    * Shift the `n` variable to the right by one bit.
3. Return the `res` variable.

The code works by repeatedly shifting the `res` variable to the left by one bit and XORing the `res` variable with 1 if the least significant bit of the input integer `n` is set. This process is repeated until all of the bits of the input integer `n` have been processed.

**Here is an example of how the code would be used:**
```cpp
uint32_t reverseBits(uint32_t n) {
    uint32_t res = 0;
    for(int i = 0 ; i < 32 ; i++){
        res <<= 1;
        if(n&1)
            res = res^1;
        n >>= 1;
    }
    return res;
}
```


```c++
uint32_t n = 0b1011; // 11 in decimal

uint32_t reversed_bits = reverseBits(n);

cout << reversed_bits << endl; // prints 0b1101 (13 in decimal)
```

This code is relatively simple and efficient, and it can be easily implemented in any programming language.
