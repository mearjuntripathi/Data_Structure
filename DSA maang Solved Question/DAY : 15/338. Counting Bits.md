# [338. Counting Bits](https://leetcode.com/problems/counting-bits/)

Given an integer `n`, return an array `ans` of length `n + 1` such that for each `i` (`0 <= i <= n`), `ans[i]` is the **number of **`1`**'s** in the *binary representation* of `i`.

 

**Example 1:**

> **Input:** n = 2<br>
**Output:** [0,1,1]<br>
**Explanation:**<br>
0 --> 0<br>
1 --> 1<br>
2 --> 10

**Example 2:**

> **Input:** n = 5<br>
**Output:** [0,1,1,2,1,2]<br>
**Explanation:**<br>
0 --> 0<br>
1 --> 1<br>
2 --> 10<br>
3 --> 11<br>
4 --> 100<br>
5 --> 101
 

**Constraints:**

- `0 <= n <= 105`
 

**Follow up:**

- It is very easy to come up with a solution with a runtime of `O(n log n)`. Can you do it in linear time `O(n)` and possibly in a single pass?
- Can you do it without using any built-in function (i.e., like `__builtin_popcount` in C++)?

# Solution

The code I provided has two approaches for counting the number of set bits in an integer:

**Approach 1: O(n logn)**

This approach iterates over the integer from 0 to n, and for each integer, it uses a while loop to count the number of set bits. The while loop works by repeatedly shifting the integer to the right by 1 bit and adding the least significant bit to the count. The loop terminates when the integer is zero.

```cpp
vector<int> countBits(int n) {
    vector<int> bits(n+1);

    for(int i = 0 ; i <= n ; i++){
        int temp = i;
        while(temp){
            bits[i] += temp & 1;
            temp >>= 1; 
        }
    }
    
    return bits;
}
```

**Algorithm:**

1. Initialize a variable `count` to 0.
2. Iterate over the integer from 0 to n.
3. For each integer:
    * Initialize a variable `temp` to the integer.
    * While `temp` is greater than zero:
        * Add the least significant bit of `temp` to `count`.
        * Shift `temp` to the right by 1 bit.
4. Return `count`.

**Approach 2: O(n)**

This approach uses a dynamic programming technique to count the number of set bits in an integer. The technique works by building a table of the number of set bits in all integers from 0 to n. The table is initialized with the number of set bits in each integer from 0 to 1. For all other integers, the number of set bits is calculated by adding the number of set bits in the integer's rightmost bit and the number of set bits in the integer shifted to the right by 1 bit.

```cpp
vector<int> countBits(int n) {
    vector<int> bits(n+1);

    for(int i = 0 ; i <= n; i++)
        bits[i] = bits[i>>1] + (i&1);
    
    return bits;
}
```

**Algorithm:**

1. Initialize a table `bits` with the number of set bits in all integers from 0 to 1.
2. Iterate over the integer from 2 to n.
3. For each integer:
    * Set `bits[i]` to `bits[i >> 1] + (i & 1)`.
4. Return `bits[n]`.

The second approach is more efficient than the first approach because it only iterates over the integer once and performs constant-time operations at each step.
