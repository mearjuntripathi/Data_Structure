# [191. Number of 1 Bits](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-1-bits/)

Write a function that takes the binary representation of an unsigned integer and returns the number of '1' bits it has (also known as the [Hamming weight](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_weight)).

**Note:**

- Note that in some languages, such as Java, there is no unsigned integer type. In this case, the input will be given as a signed integer type. It should not affect your implementation, as the integer's internal binary representation is the same, whether it is signed or unsigned.
- In Java, the compiler represents the signed integers using [2's complement notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two%27s_complement). Therefore, in **Example 3**, the input represents the signed integer. `-3`.
 

**Example 1:**

> **Input:** n = 00000000000000000000000000001011<br>
**Output:** 3<br>
**Explanation:** The input binary string **00000000000000000000000000001011** has a total of three '1' bits.

**Example 2:**

> **Input:** n = 00000000000000000000000010000000<br>
**Output:** 1<br>
**Explanation:** The input binary string **00000000000000000000000010000000** has a total of one '1' bit.

**Example 3:**

> **Input:** n = 11111111111111111111111111111101<br>
**Output:** 31<br>
**Explanation:** The input binary string **11111111111111111111111111111101** has a total of thirty one '1' bits.
 

**Constraints:**

- The input must be a binary string of length `32`.
 

**Follow up:** If this function is called many times, how would you optimize it?

# Solution

The code I provided has two approaches for calculating the Hamming weight of an unsigned 32-bit integer `n`. Both approaches work by iteratively counting the number of set bits in `n` and shifting `n` to the right by one bit each iteration.

**Approach 1** uses the bitwise AND operator (`&`) to check if the least significant bit of `n` is set. If it is set, then the count is incremented. The bitwise right shift operator (`>>`) is then used to shift `n` to the right by one bit. This process is repeated until `n` is zero.

**Approach 2** uses the modulo operator (`%`) to check if the least significant bit of `n` is set. If it is set, then the count is incremented. The integer division operator (`/`) is then used to divide `n` by two. This process is repeated until `n` is zero.

Both approaches have a time complexity of O(1), since the number of iterations required to calculate the Hamming weight is equal to the number of set bits in `n`.

**Algorithm**

1. Initialize a count variable to zero.
2. While `n` is not zero:
    * If the least significant bit of `n` is set, then increment the count.
    * Shift `n` to the right by one bit.
3. Return the count variable.

**Example**

```cpp
uint32_t n = 0b1011; // 11 in decimal

// Approach 1
int count = 0;
while (n) {
  count += n & 1;
  n >>= 1;
}

// Approach 2
int count = 0;
while (n) {
  count += n % 2;
  n /= 2;
}

// Both approaches will return the same result, which is 3.
```
