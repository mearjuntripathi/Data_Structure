# [136. Single Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/single-number/)

Given a non-empty array of integers `nums`, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.

You must implement a solution with a linear runtime complexity and use only constant extra space.

 

**Example 1:**

>**Input:** nums = [2,2,1]<br>
**Output:** 1

**Example 2:**

>**Input:** nums = [4,1,2,1,2]<br>
**Output:** 4

**Example 3:**

>**Input:** nums = [1]<br>
**Output:** 1
 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 104`
- `-3 * 104 <= nums[i] <= 3 * 104`
- Each element in the array appears twice except for one element which appears only once.

# Solution

The approach of the code is to use the XOR operator (`^`) to cancel out all of the duplicate numbers in the array. The XOR operator returns 1 if the two operands are different and 0 if the two operands are the same.

The algorithm of the code is as follows:

1. Initialize a variable `singleNumber` to the first element in the array.
2. Iterate over the array from the second element to the last element:
    * XOR the current element with `singleNumber`.
3. Return `singleNumber`.

Here is an example of how the `singleNumber()` function would be used:

```cpp
Solution solution;
int singleNumber = solution.singleNumber({1, 2, 2, 3, 1});
```

The variable `singleNumber` would then contain the value 3, which is the single number in the array.

**Explanation**

The XOR operator (`^`) has a number of properties that make it useful for canceling out duplicate numbers. One property of the XOR operator is that it is commutative, meaning that the order of the operands does not matter. This means that we can XOR the numbers in the array in any order.

Another property of the XOR operator is that it is associative, meaning that the grouping of the operands does not matter. This means that we can group the numbers in the array in any way that we want.

Finally, the XOR operator has the following identity property:

```cpp
a ^ a = 0
```

This means that XORing a number with itself will result in 0.

We can use these properties of the XOR operator to cancel out all of the duplicate numbers in the array. The following is a step-by-step explanation of how the `singleNumber()` function works:

1. Initialize `singleNumber` to the first element in the array.
2. Iterate over the array from the second element to the last element.
    * XOR the current element with `singleNumber`.

At the end of the iteration, `singleNumber` will contain the XOR of all of the elements in the array. Since all of the duplicate numbers will be XORed with themselves and result in 0, `singleNumber` will contain the single number in the array.

This algorithm has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the array. This is because the algorithm iterates over the array once. The algorithm has a space complexity of O(1), since it does not require any additional memory.
