# [540. Single Element in a Sorted Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/single-element-in-a-sorted-array/)

You are given a sorted array consisting of only integers where every element appears exactly twice, except for one element which appears exactly once.

Return the single element that appears only once.

Your solution must run in `O(log n)` time and `O(1)` space.

**Example 1:**

>**Input:** nums = [1,1,2,3,3,4,4,8,8]<br>
**Output:** 2

**Example 2:**

>**Input:** nums = [3,3,7,7,10,11,11]<br>
**Output:** 10

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 1e5`
- `0 <= nums[i] <= 1e5`

# Solution

The approach of the given solution is to use binary search to find the single non-duplicate element in the array. The algorithm is as follows:

1. Initialize two pointers, `start` and `end`, to point to the beginning and end of the array, respectively.
2. If the array has less than two elements, then the single non-duplicate element is the first element.
3. If the first and second elements of the array are not equal, then the single non-duplicate element is the first element.
4. If the last two elements of the array are not equal, then the single non-duplicate element is the last element.
5. Otherwise, enter a while loop:
    * Calculate the middle index, `mid`, of the array.
    * If `mid` is odd, then compare the element at index `mid` to the element at index `mid-1`.
        * If they are equal, then the single non-duplicate element is in the right half of the array, so set `start` to `mid+1`.
        * Otherwise, the single non-duplicate element is in the left half of the array, so set `end` to `mid-1`.
    * Otherwise, `mid` is even, so compare the element at index `mid` to the element at index `mid+1`.
        * If they are equal, then the single non-duplicate element is in the left half of the array, so set `end` to `mid-1`.
        * Otherwise, the single non-duplicate element is in the right half of the array, so set `start` to `mid+1`.
6. The while loop will terminate when `start` and `end` are equal. At this point, the single non-duplicate element is the element at index `start`.

Here is a C++ implementation of the above algorithm:

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int singleNonDuplicate(vector<int>& nums) {
        int start = 0;
        int end = nums.size()-1;
        if(end < 2) return nums[0];
        if(nums[0] != nums[1]) return nums[0];
        if(nums[end-1] != nums[end]) return nums[end];
        
        while(start <= end){
            int mid = start + (end - start)/2;
            if(nums[mid] != nums[mid-1] && nums[mid] != nums[mid+1])
                return nums[mid];
            if(mid%2){
                if(nums[mid] == nums[mid+1])
                    end = mid - 1;
                else 
                    start = mid + 1;
            }else{
                if(nums[mid] == nums[mid+1])
                    start = mid + 1;
                else 
                    end = mid - 1;
            }
        }
        return nums[start];
    }
};
```

This algorithm has a time complexity of O(log n) and a space complexity of O(1).
