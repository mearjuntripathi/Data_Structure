# [287. Find the Duplicate Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-duplicate-number/)

Given an array of integers nums containing `n + 1` integers where each integer is in the range `[1, n]` inclusive.

There is only one repeated number in `nums`, return this repeated number.

You must solve the problem without modifying the array `nums` and uses only constant extra space.

 


**Example 1:**

>**Input:** nums = [1,3,4,2,2]<br>
**Output:** 2

**Example 2:**

>**Input:** nums = [3,1,3,4,2]<br>
**Output:** 3
 

**Constraints:**
- `1 <= n <= 1e5`
- `nums.length == n + 1`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= n`
- All the integers in `nums` appear only once except for precisely one integer which appears two or more times.
 

**Follow up:**

- How can we prove that at least one duplicate number must exist in `nums`?
- Can you solve the problem in linear runtime complexity?

# Solution

The approach used in the given solution is called **binary search**. The algorithm works as follows:

1. Initialize two pointers, `low` and `high`, to the beginning and end of the array, respectively.
2. While `low` is less than `high`:
    * Find the middle element of the array, `mid`.
    * Count the number of elements in the array that are less than or equal to `mid`.
    * If the count is greater than `mid`, then the duplicate element must be in the left half of the array, so set `high` to `mid`.
    * Otherwise, the duplicate element must be in the right half of the array, so set `low` to `mid + 1`.
3. When `low` is equal to `high`, the duplicate element is the element at index `low`.

Here is a more detailed explanation of the algorithm:

```c++
int findDuplicate(vector<int>& nums) {
    int low = 0;
    int high = nums.size()-1;

    while(low < high){
        int mid = low + (high - low) / 2;
        int c = 0;
        for(auto &num : nums)
            if(num <= mid) c++;
        if(c > mid) high = mid;
        else low = mid + 1;
    }
    return low;   
}
```

* **Line 1:** Declare two variables, `low` and `high`, to store the indices of the beginning and end of the array, respectively.
* **Line 2:** Initialize `low` to 0 and `high` to the size of the array minus 1.
* **Line 4:** While `low` is less than `high`, repeat the following steps:
    * **Line 5:** Find the middle element of the array, `mid`.
    * **Line 6:** Count the number of elements in the array that are less than or equal to `mid`. Store this count in the variable `c`.
    * **Line 7:** If the count is greater than `mid`, then the duplicate element must be in the left half of the array. Set `high` to `mid` to search the left half of the array in the next iteration.
    * **Line 9:** Otherwise, the duplicate element must be in the right half of the array. Set `low` to `mid + 1` to search the right half of the array in the next iteration.
* **Line 11:** When `low` is equal to `high`, the duplicate element is the element at index `low`. Return this element.

This algorithm is efficient because it only needs to iterate over the array once. It is also versatile and can be used to find duplicates in arrays of any size.
