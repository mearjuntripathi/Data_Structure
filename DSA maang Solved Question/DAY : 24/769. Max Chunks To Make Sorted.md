# [769. Max Chunks To Make Sorted](https://leetcode.com/problems/max-chunks-to-make-sorted/)

You are given an integer array `arr` of length `n` that represents a permutation of the integers in the range `[0, n - 1]`.

We split `arr` into some number of chunks (i.e., partitions), and individually sort each chunk. After concatenating them, the result should equal the sorted array.

Return the largest number of chunks we can make to sort the array.

 

**Example 1:**

>**Input:** arr = [4,3,2,1,0]<br>
**Output:** 1<br>
**Explanation:**<br>
Splitting into two or more chunks will not return the required result.<bt>
For example, splitting into [4, 3], [2, 1, 0] will result in [3, 4, 0, 1, 2], which isn't sorted.

**Example 2:**

>**Input:** arr = [1,0,2,3,4]<br>
**Output:** 4<br>
**Explanation:**<br>
We can split into two chunks, such as [1, 0], [2, 3, 4].<bt>
However, splitting into [1, 0], [2], [3], [4] is the highest number of chunks possible.

 

**Constraints:**

- `n == arr.length`
- `1 <= n <= 10`
- `0 <= arr[i] < n`
- All the elements of arr are unique.

# Solution

The approach used in the given solution is a greedy approach. The algorithm works as follows:

1. Initialize two variables, `chunk` and `mx`. `chunk` will represent the number of chunks in the sorted array, and `mx` will represent the maximum value in the current chunk.
2. Iterate over the array, starting from the first element.
3. For each element in the array, compare it to `mx`. If the current element is greater than `mx`, then update `mx` to the value of the current element.
4. If the current element is equal to `mx`, then increment `chunk` by 1.
5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 until the end of the array is reached.
6. Return `chunk`.

This algorithm is greedy because it always takes the next element in the array and adds it to the current chunk. If the current element is greater than the maximum value in the current chunk, then the algorithm creates a new chunk.

Here is a more detailed explanation of the algorithm:

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int maxChunksToSorted(vector<int>& arr) {
        int chunk = 0;
        int mx = arr[0];
        int i = 0;

        for(auto &a : arr){
            mx = max(mx, a);

            if(mx == i++) chunk++;
        }
        return chunk ;
    }
};
```

* **Line 1:** This line declares a function called `maxChunksToSorted()` which takes a vector of integers as input and returns the maximum number of chunks in the sorted array.
* **Line 3:** This line declares a variable called `chunk` which will represent the number of chunks in the sorted array.
* **Line 4:** This line declares a variable called `mx` which will represent the maximum value in the current chunk.
* **Line 5:** This line declares a variable called `i` which will be used to iterate over the array.
* **Line 7:** This line starts a for loop which iterates over the array, starting from the first element.
* **Line 8:** This line compares the current element in the array to `mx`. If the current element is greater than `mx`, then `mx` is updated to the value of the current element.
* **Line 10:** This line checks if the current element is equal to `mx`. If it is, then `chunk` is incremented by 1.
* **Line 12:** This line ends the for loop.
* **Line 13:** This line returns the value of `chunk`.

This algorithm is efficient because it only needs to iterate over the array once. It also has a simple implementation.
