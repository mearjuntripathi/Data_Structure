# [274. H-Index](https://leetcode.com/problems/h-index/)

Given an array of integers `citations` where `citations[i]` is the number of citations a researcher received for their `ith` paper, return the researcher's h-index.

According to the [definition of h-index on Wikipedia:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H-index) The h-index is defined as the maximum value of `h` such that the given researcher has published at least `h` papers that have each been cited at least `h` times.

 

**Example 1:**

>**Input:** citations = [3,0,6,1,5]<br>
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:** [3,0,6,1,5] means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each of them had received 3, 0, 6, 1, 5 citations respectively.
Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and the remaining two with no more than 3 citations each, their h-index is 3.

**Example 2:**

>**Input:** citations = [1,3,1]<br>
**Output:** 1
 

**Constraints:**

- `n == citations.length`
- `1 <= n <= 5000`
- `0 <= citations[i] <= 1000`

# Solution

The approach for the given C++ solution to the h-index problem is to first sort the citations array in descending order. This allows us to easily iterate over the array and find the largest h-index value.

The algorithm works as follows:

1. Initialize the h-index value to 0.
2. Iterate over the citations array in descending order.
3. For each citation, compare it to the current h-index value. If the citation is greater than or equal to the h-index value, then update the h-index value.
4. Return the h-index value.

Here is a step-by-step explanation of the C++ code:

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int hIndex(vector<int>& citations) {
        // Sort the citations array in descending order.
        sort(citations.begin(), citations.end());

        // Initialize the h-index value.
        int hIndex = 0;

        // Iterate over the citations array in descending order.
        for (auto &citation : citations) {
        // Compare the citation to the current h-index value.
        hIndex = max(hIndex, min(citation, n - i++));
        }

        // Return the h-index value.
        return hIndex;
    }
};
```

This algorithm is efficient because it only needs to iterate over the citations array once. It also has a good time complexity of O(n log n), where n is the number of citations.
