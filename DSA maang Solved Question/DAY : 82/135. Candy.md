# [135. Candy](https://leetcode.com/problems/candy/)

There are `n` children standing in a line. Each child is assigned a rating value given in the integer array `ratings`.

You are giving candies to these children subjected to the following requirements:

- Each child must have at least one candy.
- Children with a higher rating get more candies than their neighbors.

Return the minimum number of candies you need to have to distribute the candies to the children.

**Example 1:**

>**Input:** ratings = [1,0,2]<br>
**Output:** 5<br>
**Explanation:** You can allocate to the first, second and third child with 2, 1, 2 candies respectively.

**Example 2:**

>**Input:** ratings = [1,2,2]<br>
**Output:** 4<br>
**Explanation:** You can allocate to the first, second and third child with 1, 2, 1 candies respectively.<br>
The third child gets 1 candy because it satisfies the above two conditions.
 

**Constraints:**

- `n == ratings.length`
- `1 <= n <= 2 * 1e4`
- `0 <= ratings[i] <= 2 * 1e4`

# Solution
Sure, here is the code for the `candy` function in C++, along with an explanation of the algorithm and approach:

**Algorithm:**

The algorithm for this problem is a greedy algorithm. A greedy algorithm is an algorithm that makes the best decision at each step, without considering the long-term consequences. In this case, the best decision at each step is to give the current child one more candy than the previous child if the current child's rating is higher than the previous child's rating.

**Approach:**

The approach for this problem is to iterate over the ratings array twice. On the first iteration, we iterate from left to right and give each child one more candy than the previous child if the current child's rating is higher than the previous child's rating. On the second iteration, we iterate from right to left and give each child one more candy than the next child if the current child's rating is higher than the next child's rating. Finally, we calculate the total number of candies and return it.

**Code:**

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int candy(vector<int>& ratings) {
        int size = ratings.size();
        vector<int> candies(size, 1);

        for(int i = 1 ; i < size ; i++)
            if(ratings[i] > ratings[i-1])
                candies[i] = candies[i-1] + 1;
        
        for(int i = size - 2 ; i >= 0 ; i--)
            if(ratings[i] > ratings[i+1])
                candies[i] = max(candies[i], candies[i+1] + 1);
        
        int totalCandies = 0;
        for(const int &candy : candies)
            totalCandies += candy;
        
        return totalCandies;
    }
};
```

I hope this helps!
