# [215. Kth Largest Element in an Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/kth-largest-element-in-an-array/)

Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`, return the kth largest element in the array.

Note that it is the `kth` largest element in the sorted order, not the `kth` distinct element.

Can you solve it without sorting?

**Example 1:**

>**Input:** nums = [3,2,1,5,6,4], k = 2<br>
**Output:** 5

**Example 2:**

>**Input:** nums = [3,2,3,1,2,4,5,5,6], k = 4<br>
**Output:** 4
 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= k <= nums.length <= 1e5`
- `-1e4 <= nums[i] <= 1e4`

# Solution

Sure. Here is a detailed approach and algorithm for the given C++ code:

**Approach:**

The given code utilizes the `priority_queue` data structure from the C++ Standard Library to efficiently identify the k-th largest element in the input vector `nums`. The `priority_queue` maintains its elements in a sorted order, with the top element being the largest. This property is leveraged to extract the k-th largest element in a straightforward manner.

**Algorithm:**

1. **Initialize a priority queue:** Create a `priority_queue` object `pq` and initialize it with the elements of the input vector `nums`. The `priority_queue` will automatically maintain the elements in a sorted order, with the largest element being the top element.

2. **Extract k-1 elements:** Pop `k-1` elements from the `priority_queue` using the `pq.pop()` operation. This effectively removes the `k-1` largest elements from the queue, leaving the k-th largest element as the top element.

3. **Return the top element:** The remaining element in the `priority_queue` is the k-th largest element in the original vector `nums`. Return this element as the result of the function.

**C++ Implementation:**

The provided C++ code implements the described approach and algorithm:

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int findKthLargest(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        priority_queue<int> pq(nums.begin(), nums.end());
        while (--k) pq.pop();
        return pq.top();
    }
};
```

This code effectively identifies the k-th largest element in the input vector `nums` using the `priority_queue` data structure and the described approach. The function `findKthLargest` returns the k-th largest element as the result.
