# [692. Top K Frequent Words](https://leetcode.com/problems/top-k-frequent-words/)

Given an array of strings `words` and an integer `k`, return the k most frequent strings.

Return the answer sorted by the frequency from highest to lowest. Sort the `words` with the same frequency by their lexicographical order.

**Example 1:**

>**Input:** words = ["i","love","leetcode","i","love","coding"], k = 2<br>
**Output:** ["i","love"]<br>
**Explanation:** "i" and "love" are the two most frequent words.<br>
Note that "i" comes before "love" due to a lower alphabetical order.

**Example 2:**

>**Input:** words = ["the","day","is","sunny","the","the","the","sunny","is","is"], k = 4<br>
**Output:** ["the","is","sunny","day"]<br>
**Explanation:** "the", "is", "sunny" and "day" are the four most frequent words, with the number of occurrence being 4, 3, 2 and 1 respectively.
 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= words.length <= 500`
- `1 <= words[i].length <= 10`
- `words[i]` consists of lowercase English letters.
- `k` is in the range `[1, The number of unique words[i]]`
 

**Follow-up:** Could you solve it in `O(n log(k))` time and `O(n)` extra space?

# Solution
Sure, here is an approach and algorithm for the provided solution in C++:

**Approach**

The problem of finding the top K most frequent words in a given list can be solved using a hash table to store the frequency of each word, and a priority queue to store the top K most frequent words.

**Algorithm**

1. Create a hash table `mp` to store the frequency of each word in the list `words`.
2. For each word `word` in the list `words`, increment the counter for that word in the hash table `mp`.
3. Create a priority queue `pq` to store the top K most frequent words.
4. For each pair of key-value `(word, frequency)` in the hash table `mp`, push the pair onto the priority queue `pq`.
5. Use the custom comparator function `compare` to compare pairs of words based on their frequency.
6. Remove the top K most frequent words from the priority queue `pq` and add them to the result vector `result`.

**Implementation**

Here is the implementation of the algorithm in C++:

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    vector<string> topKFrequent(vector<string>& words, int k) {
        unordered_map<string, int> mp;
        for (auto word : words)
            mp[word]++;

        priority_queue<pair<int, string>, vector<pair<int, string>>, Compare> pq;

        for (auto it : mp)
            pq.push({it.second, it.first});

        vector<string> result;
        for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
            pair<int, string> p = pq.top();
            pq.pop();
            result.push_back(p.second);
        }

        return result;
    }

private:
    struct Compare {
        bool operator()(const pair<int, string>& p1, const pair<int, string>& p2) const {
            if (p1.first == p2.first)
                return p1.second < p2.second;
            return p1.first > p2.first;
        }
    };
};
```

**Complexity**

The time complexity of the algorithm is O(n log n), where n is the number of words in the list. The space complexity of the algorithm is O(n), where n is the number of words in the list.

I hope this helps!
