# [146. LRU Cache](https://leetcode.com/problems/lru-cache/)

Design a data structure that follows the constraints of a [Least Recently Used (LRU) cache](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_replacement_policies#LRU).

Implement the `LRUCache` class:

- `LRUCache(int capacity)` Initialize the LRU cache with **positive** size `capacity`.
- `int get(int key)` Return the value of the `key` if the key exists, otherwise return `-1`.
- `void put(int key, int value)` Update the value of the `key` if the `key` exists. Otherwise, add the `key-value` pair to the cache. If the number of keys exceeds the `capacity` from this operation, evict the least recently used key.

The functions `get` and `put` must each run in `O(1)` average time complexity.

**Example 1:**

>**Input**<br>
["LRUCache", "put", "put", "get", "put", "get", "put", "get", "get", "get"]<br>
[[2], [1, 1], [2, 2], [1], [3, 3], [2], [4, 4], [1], [3], [4]]<br>
**Output**<br>
[null, null, null, 1, null, -1, null, -1, 3, 4]
>
>**Explanation**
LRUCache lRUCache = new LRUCache(2);<br>
lRUCache.put(1, 1); // cache is {1=1}<br>
lRUCache.put(2, 2); // cache is {1=1, 2=2}<br>
lRUCache.get(1);    // return 1<br>
lRUCache.put(3, 3); // LRU key was 2, evicts key 2, cache is {1=1, 3=3}<br>
lRUCache.get(2);    // returns -1 (not found)<br>
lRUCache.put(4, 4); // LRU key was 1, evicts key 1, cache is {4=4, 3=3}<br>
lRUCache.get(1);    // return -1 (not found)<br>
lRUCache.get(3);    // return 3<br>
lRUCache.get(4);    // return 4
 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= capacity <= 3000`
- `0 <= key <= 1e4`
- `0 <= value <= 1e5`
- At most `2 * 1e5` calls will be made to `get` and `put`.

# Solution

The approach and algorithm for the LRUCache class in C++ are as follows:

**Approach:**

The LRUCache class uses a doubly linked list to maintain the recency of the cached elements. The most recently used element is at the head of the linked list, and the least recently used element is at the tail of the linked list. When a new element is added to the cache, it is added to the head of the linked list. When an element is accessed from the cache, it is moved to the head of the linked list. If the cache is full, the least recently used element is removed from the cache.

**Algorithm:**

The LRUCache class has two main functions: `get()` and `put()`.

The `get()` function takes a key as input and returns the value associated with the key, if it exists in the cache. Otherwise, it returns -1. The `get()` function works as follows:

1. If the key exists in the cache, the value associated with the key is returned.
2. If the key does not exist in the cache, the cache is searched for the least recently used element.
3. The least recently used element is removed from the cache and its value is returned.

The `put()` function takes a key and a value as input and stores the value in the cache, associated with the key. The `put()` function works as follows:

1. If the key exists in the cache, the value associated with the key is updated.
2. If the key does not exist in the cache, a new element is added to the cache with the given key and value.
3. If the cache is full, the least recently used element is removed from the cache.

**Implementation:**

The LRUCache class can be implemented in C++ as follows:

```c++
class LRUCache {
private:
    Node* lru;
    Node* tail;
    int capacity;
    int size;
    unordered_map<int, int> map;
    unordered_map<int, Node*> address;

public:
    LRUCache(int capacity) : capacity(capacity), size(0) {}

    int get(int key) {
        if (map.find(key) == map.end()) {
            return -1;
        }

        update(key);
        return map[key];
    }

    void put(int key, int value) {
        if (map.find(key) != map.end()) {
            update(key);
            map[key] = value;
            return;
        }

        if (size == capacity) {
            removeLRU();
        }

        Node* newNode = new Node(key, value);
        address[key] = newNode;

        if (size == 0) {
            lru = newNode;
            tail = newNode;
        } else {
            tail->next = newNode;
            newNode->prev = tail;
            tail = newNode;
        }

        size++;
        map[key] = value;
    }

private:
    void update(int key) {
        Node* node = address[key];

        if (node == tail) {
            return;
        }

        if (node->next != nullptr && node->prev != nullptr) {
            node->next->prev = node->prev;
            node->prev->next = node->next;

            tail->next = node;
            node->prev = tail;
            tail = tail->next;
        }

        if (node->prev == nullptr) {
            if (lru == node) {
                lru = lru->next;
            }

            tail->next = node;
            node->prev = tail;
            node->next = nullptr;
            tail = node;
        }
    }

    void removeLRU() {
        Node* node = lru;
        map.erase(node->key);
        address.erase(node->key);

        lru = lru->next;
        if (lru != nullptr) {
            lru->prev = nullptr;
        }

        delete node;
        size--;
    }
};
```

This implementation of the LRUCache class is efficient and scalable. It uses a constant amount of time to perform the `get()` and `put()` operations.
