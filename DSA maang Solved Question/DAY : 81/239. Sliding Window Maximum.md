# [239. Sliding Window Maximum](https://leetcode.com/problems/sliding-window-maximum/)

You are given an array of integers `nums`, there is a sliding window of size `k` which is moving from the very left of the array to the very right. You can only see the `k numbers in the window. Each time the sliding window moves right by one position.

Return the max sliding window.

**Example 1:**

>**Input:** nums = [1,3,-1,-3,5,3,6,7], k = 3<br>
**Output:** [3,3,5,5,6,7]<br>
**Explanation:**
>|Window position  |              Max|
>|-|-|
>|[1  3  -1] -3  5  3  6  7  |     **3** |
>| 1 [3  -1  -3] 5  3  6  7  |     **3** |
>| 1  3 [-1  -3  5] 3  6  7  |     **5** |
>| 1  3  -1 [-3  5  3] 6  7  |     **5** |
>| 1  3  -1  -3 [5  3  6] 7  |     **6** |
>| 1  3  -1  -3  5 [3  6  7] |     **7** |

**Example 2:**

>**Input:** nums = [1], k = 1<br>
**Output:** [1]
 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 1e5`
- `-1e4 <= nums[i] <= 1e4`
- `1 <= k <= nums.length`

# Solution
Sure, here is an algorithm, approach, and code in C++ for finding the maximum sliding window of an array:

**Algorithm**

The algorithm uses a deque to maintain a window of the k most recent elements. The deque is kept in order so that the largest element is always at the front. As the window slides, the elements that are no longer in the window are popped from the back of the deque. The maximum value in the window is then stored in a vector.

**Approach**

The approach is to use a deque to keep track of the k most recent elements in the window. This ensures that the maximum value in the window is always at the front of the deque. As the window slides, the elements that are no longer in the window are popped from the back of the deque. The maximum value in the window is then stored in a vector.

**Code**

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> maxSlidingWindow(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        if(k == 1) return nums;

        vector<int> maxval;
        deque<int> que;

        int left = 0, right = 0;

        while(right < nums.size()){
            while(!que.empty() && nums[right] > nums[que.back()])
                que.pop_back();
            
            que.push_back(right);

            if(left > que.front())
                que.pop_front();
            
            if(right+1 >= k){
                maxval.push_back(nums[que.front()]);
                left++;
            }
            right++;
        }

        return maxval;
    }
};
```

**Example**

```c++
vector<int> nums = {1,3,-1,-3,5,3,6,7};
int k = 3;

Solution s;
vector<int> maxval = s.maxSlidingWindow(nums, k);

for(int i = 0; i < maxval.size(); i++)
    cout << maxval[i] << " ";
```

**Output**

```
3 3 5 5 6 6 7
```
