# [42. Trapping Rain Water](https://leetcode.com/problems/trapping-rain-water/)

Given `n` non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is `1`, compute how much water it can trap after raining. 


**Example 1:**

>**Input:** height = [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]<br>
**Output:** 6<br>
**Explanation:** The above elevation map (black section) is represented by array [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]. In this case, 6 units of rain water (blue section) are being trapped.

**Example 2:**

>**Input:** height = [4,2,0,3,2,5]<br>
**Output**: 9
 

**Constraints:**

- `n == height.length`
- `1 <= n <= 2 * 1e4`
- `0 <= height[i] <= 1e5`

# Solution

Sure, here is the algorithm and approach for the given C++ code:

**Algorithm:**

1. **Initialize two arrays:** `leftmost` and `rightmost`, each with the same size as the input array `height`.
2. **Fill the `leftmost` array:** Iterate through the `height` array from left to right. For each element `height[i]`, if it is greater than or equal to the previous element `leftmost[i-1]`, set `leftmost[i] = height[i]`; otherwise, set `leftmost[i] = leftmost[i-1]`.
3. **Fill the `rightmost` array:** Iterate through the `height` array from right to left. For each element `height[i]`, if it is greater than or equal to the previous element `rightmost[i+1]`, set `rightmost[i] = height[i]`; otherwise, set `rightmost[i] = rightmost[i+1]`.
4. **Calculate the trapped water:** Initialize a variable `contain` to store the total amount of trapped water. Iterate through the `height` array. For each element `height[i]`, calculate the minimum water level between `leftmost[i]` and `rightmost[i]`, and subtract `height[i]` from it to get the amount of trapped water at that position. Add this amount to `contain`.
5. **Return the total amount of trapped water:** Return the value of `contain`.

**Approach:**

1. **Two-pointer approach:** Use two pointers, `left` and `right`, to traverse the `height` array from left to right and right to left, respectively. For each position, calculate the minimum water level between the `left` and `right` pointers and subtract `height[i]` from it to get the amount of trapped water at that position.
2. **Preprocessing:** Preprocess the `height` array to calculate the maximum water level reachable from both the left and right ends of the array. Store this information in two arrays, `leftmost` and `rightmost`. This avoids the need to recalculate the minimum water level at each position.

**Code:**

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int trap(vector<int>& height) {
        int n = height.size();
        int leftmost[n];
        int rightmost[n];
        leftmost[0] = height[0];
        rightmost[n-1] = height[n-1];
        
        for(int i = 1 ; i < n ; i++){
            if(leftmost[i-1] > height[i])
                leftmost[i] = leftmost[i-1];
            else leftmost[i] = height[i];
            
            if(rightmost[n-i] > height[n-i-1])
                rightmost[n-i-1] = rightmost[n-i];
            else rightmost[n-i-1] = height[n-i-1];
        }
        
        long long contain = 0;
        for(int i = 0 ; i < n ; i++){
            contain += min(leftmost[i],rightmost[i])-height[i];
        }
        
        return contain;
    }
};
```

**Complexity:**

The time complexity of the algorithm is O(n), where n is the length of the input array. The space complexity is also O(n), due to the two preprocessed arrays.
