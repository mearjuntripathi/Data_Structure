# [343. Integer Break](https://leetcode.com/problems/integer-break/)

Given an integer `n`, break it into the sum of `k` positive integers, where `k >= 2`, and maximize the product of those integers.

Return the maximum product you can get.

**Example 1:**

>**Input:** n = 2<br>
**Output:** 1<br>
**Explanation:** 2 = 1 + 1, 1 × 1 = 1.

**Example 2:**

>**Input:** n = 10<br>
**Output:** 36<br>
**Explanation:** 10 = 3 + 3 + 4, 3 × 3 × 4 = 36.
 

**Constraints:**

- `2 <= n <= 58`
---
# Solution
**Approach:**

The approach for this solution is to break the integer `n` into the largest possible factors of 3, and then multiply the factors together. This is because the largest product that can be obtained from breaking an integer into smaller integers is obtained by breaking it into factors of 3.

**Algorithm:**

1. Check if the integer `n` is less than 4. If it is, then return `n-1`.
2. Initialize a variable `product` to 1.
3. While `n` is greater than 4:
    * Multiply `product` by 3.
    * Subtract 3 from `n`.
4. Multiply `product` by `n`.
5. Return `product`.

**C++ code:**

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int integerBreak(int n) {
        if(n < 4) return n-1;

        int product = 1;
        while(n > 4){
            product *= 3;
            n -= 3;
        }
        product *= n;

        return product;
    }
};
```

**Example:**

```c++
Solution solution;
int product = solution.integerBreak(10);

std::cout << product << std::endl; // Output: 36
```

This is because 10 can be broken down into 3 factors of 3 and 1 factor of 1, and the product of these factors is 36.
