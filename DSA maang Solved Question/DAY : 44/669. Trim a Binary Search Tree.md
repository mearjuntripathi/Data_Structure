# [669. Trim a Binary Search Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/trim-a-binary-search-tree/)

Given the `root` of a binary search tree and the lowest and highest boundaries as `low` and `high`, trim the tree so that all its elements lies in `[low, high]`. Trimming the tree should not change the relative structure of the elements that will remain in the tree (i.e., any node's descendant should remain a descendant). It can be proven that there is a unique answer.

Return the root of the trimmed binary search tree. Note that the root may change depending on the given bounds.

**Example 1:**

>**Input:** root = [1,0,2], low = 1, high = 2<br>
**Output:** [1,null,2]

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/09/09/trim2.jpg)

>**Input:** root = [3,0,4,null,2,null,null,1], low = 1, high = 3<br>
**Output:** [3,2,null,1]
 

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 1e4]`.
- `0 <= Node.val <= 1e4`
- The value of each node in the tree is unique.
- `root` is guaranteed to be a valid binary search tree.
- `0 <= low <= high <= 1e4`

# Solution
The approach of the solution to the Trim a Binary Search Tree problem in C++ is to recursively traverse the tree and trim the left and right subtrees of each node such that all the nodes in the subtree are within the given range. If the node itself is outside the given range, then the node is also removed.

The algorithm is as follows:

1. If the root node is null, return null.
2. Recursively trim the left and right subtrees of the root node.
3. If the root node's value is less than the low bound or greater than the high bound, then remove the root node and return the left or right subtree, whichever is not null.
4. Otherwise, return the root node.

The following is the C++ implementation of the algorithm:

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    TreeNode* trimBST(TreeNode* root, int low, int high) {
        if (!root) return NULL;
        root->left = trimBST(root->left, low, high);
        root->right = trimBST(root->right, low, high);

        if (root->val < low || root->val > high) {
            root = root->left ? root->left : root->right;
        }
        return root;
    }
};
```

This algorithm is time-efficient and space-efficient. It uses O(n) time to traverse the tree and O(1) space to store the stack frames of the recursive calls.
