# [297. Serialize and Deserialize Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/serialize-and-deserialize-binary-tree/)

Serialization is the process of converting a data structure or object into a sequence of bits so that it can be stored in a file or memory buffer, or transmitted across a network connection link to be reconstructed later in the same or another computer environment.

Design an algorithm to serialize and deserialize a binary tree. There is no restriction on how your serialization/deserialization algorithm should work. You just need to ensure that a binary tree can be serialized to a string and this string can be deserialized to the original tree structure.

**Clarification:** The input/output format is the same as [how LeetCode serializes a binary tree](https://support.leetcode.com/hc/en-us/articles/360011883654-What-does-1-null-2-3-mean-in-binary-tree-representation-). You do not necessarily need to follow this format, so please be creative and come up with different approaches yourself.

 

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/09/15/serdeser.jpg)

>**Input:** root = [1,2,3,null,null,4,5]<br>
**Output:** [1,2,3,null,null,4,5]

**Example 2:**

>**Input:** root = []<br>
**Output:** []
 

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 1e4]`.
- `-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000`

# Solution

The approach used in this C++ solution to the tree serialization and deserialization problem is to use a queue to store the nodes of the tree in a level-order traversal. The nodes are serialized as a string, with each node's value followed by a comma and then the values of its left and right children, if they exist. The deserialization process works in reverse, with the nodes being created from the string representation and added to the queue in the same order that they were serialized.

The following algorithm shows how the tree serialization and deserialization functions work:

```c++
class Codec {
public:

    // Encodes a tree to a single string.
    string serialize(TreeNode* root) {
        if (!root) {
            return "N";
        }

        queue<TreeNode*> que;
        que.push(root);
        string data = to_string(root->val);

        while (!que.empty()) {
            int length = que.size();
            for (int i = 0; i < length; i++) {
                TreeNode* dummy = que.front();
                que.pop();

                if (dummy->left) {
                    data += "," + to_string(dummy->left->val);
                    que.push(dummy->left);
                } else {
                    data += ",N";
                }

                if (dummy->right) {
                    data += "," + to_string(dummy->right->val);
                    que.push(dummy->right);
                } else {
                    data += ",N";
                }

                dummy->left = NULL;
                dummy->right = NULL;
            }
        }

        return data;
    }

    // Decodes your encoded data to tree.
    TreeNode* deserialize(string data) {
        if (data == "N") {
            return NULL;
        }

        int pos = 0;
        string val = substr(data, pos);
        TreeNode* root = new TreeNode(stoi(val));
        queue<TreeNode*> que;
        que.push(root);

        while (!que.empty()) {
            int length = que.size();
            for (int i = 0; i < length; i++) {
                TreeNode* dummy = que.front();
                que.pop();

                val = substr(data, pos);
                if (val != "N") {
                    dummy->left = new TreeNode(stoi(val));
                    que.push(dummy->left);
                }

                val = substr(data, pos);
                if (val != "N") {
                    dummy->right = new TreeNode(stoi(val));
                    que.push(dummy->right);
                }
            }
        }

        return root;
    }
};
```

The `substr()` function in the `deserialize()` function is used to extract the value of the next node from the string representation. It works by iterating over the string until it reaches a comma or the end of the string. The value of the node is then converted to an integer and returned.

This approach is efficient and easy to implement. It uses O(n) space to serialize and deserialize the tree, where n is the number of nodes in the tree. The time complexity of the serialization and deserialization functions is O(n), since they both traverse the tree in a level-order manner.
