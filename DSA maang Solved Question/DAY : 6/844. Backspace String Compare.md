# [844. Backspace String Compare](https://leetcode.com/problems/backspace-string-compare/)

Given two strings `s` and `t`, return true if they are equal when both are typed into empty text editors. `'#'` means a backspace character.

Note that after backspacing an empty text, the text will continue empty.

 

**Example 1:**
<br>
> Input: s = "ab#c", t = "ad#c"<br>
> Output: true<br>
> Explanation: Both s and t become "ac".

**Example 2:**
<br>
> Input: s = "ab##", t = "c#d#"<br>
> Output: true<br>
> Explanation: Both s and t become "".

**Example 3:**
<br>
> Input: s = "a#c", t = "b"<br>
> Output: false<br>
> Explanation: s becomes "c" while t becomes "b".
 

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= s.length, t.length <= 200`
* `s` and `t` only contain lowercase letters and `'#'` characters.
 

***Follow up:** Can you solve it in `O(n)` time and `O(1)` space?*

## Solution

**Brute Force Approach**

The given code implements a brute force algorithm to compare two strings that may contain backspaces. 

    bool backspaceCompare(string s, string t) {
        string s1;
        string t1;
        
        for(auto c : s)
            if(c == '#'){
                if(s1 != "")
                    s1.pop_back();
            }
            else s1 += c;
        
        for(auto c : t)
            if(c == '#'){
                if(t1 != "")
                    t1.pop_back();
            }
            else t1 += c;
        
        return s1 == t1;
    }

The algorithm works as follows:

1. Initialize two strings `s1` and `t1` to empty strings.
2. Iterate through the string `s`.
    * If the current character is a backspace, then remove the last character from `s1`.
    * Otherwise, append the current character to `s1`.
3. Iterate through the string `t`.
    * If the current character is a backspace, then remove the last character from `t1`.
    * Otherwise, append the current character to `t1`.
4. Return `s1 == t1`, which indicates whether the two strings are equal after removing all backspaces.

This algorithm is brute force because it tries every possible combination of backspaces to compare the two strings. It is not very efficient, but it is simple to implement.



**Here is a more detailed explanation of the algorithm:**

* The first step, initializing `s1` and `t1` to empty strings, is necessary because we need to start with a clean slate.
* The second step, iterating through the string `s`, is where the actual comparison takes place. We check each character in `s` and, depending on whether it is a backspace or not, we either remove the last character from `s1` or append the current character to `s1`.
* The third step is similar to the second step, except that we are now iterating through the string `t`.
* The fourth step simply returns whether the two strings are equal after removing all backspaces.

This algorithm can be improved by using a more efficient data structure to store the strings, such as a linked list. Additionally, we can use a technique called dynamic programming tomemoize the results of previous comparisons, so that we don't have to recompute them every time. However, these improvements would make the code more complex, so the brute force algorithm is a good starting point for understanding how to compare strings that may contain backspaces.

**Efficient Approach**

The given code implements an algorithm to remove all backspaces from a string. The algorithm works as follows:

1. Initialize a variable `idx` to 0, which will point to the current position in the string.
2. Iterate through the string.
    * If the current character is not a backspace, then add it to the string at position `idx`.
    * If the current character is a backspace, then decrement `idx`.
    * This ensures that the characters after the backspaces are not included in the string.
3. Return the string from position 0 to `idx`.

This algorithm is a simple and efficient way to remove all backspaces from a string. It is also easy to understand and implement.

    class Solution{

        string removeBackspaces(string& s)
        {
            int n = s.size();
        
            // To point at position after considering the
            // backspaces
            int idx = 0;
        
            for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
                if (s[i] != '#') {
                    s[idx] = s[i];
                    idx++;
                }
                else if (s[i] == '#' && idx >= 0) {
                    idx--;
                }
        
                // This idx can never point at negative index
                // position
                if (idx < 0)
                    idx = 0;
            }
            return s.substr(0, idx);
        }

    public:
        bool backspaceCompare(string s, string t) {
            return removeBackspaces(s) == removeBackspaces(t);
        }
    };

**Here is a more detailed explanation of the algorithm:**

* The first step, initializing `idx` to 0, is necessary because we need to start with a clean slate.
* The second step, the for loop that iterates through the string, is where the actual removal of backspaces takes place. We check each character in the string and, depending on whether it is a backspace or not, we either add it to the string or decrement the counter.
* The third step, the return statement, simply returns the string from position 0 to `idx`.

This algorithm can be improved by using a more efficient data structure to store the string, such as a linked list. Additionally, we can use a technique called dynamic programming tomemoize the results of previous removals, so that we don't have to recompute them every time. However, these improvements would make the code more complex, so the simple algorithm presented here is a good starting point for understanding how to remove backspaces from strings.

The backspace compare algorithm can be implemented using this function to remove backspaces from strings. The overall algorithm would be as follows:

1. Remove backspaces from string `s` and string `t` using the `removeBackspaces()` function.
2. Compare the two strings.
3. Return True if the two strings are equal after removing backspaces, False otherwise.

This algorithm has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the longer string, and a space complexity of O(n), since it uses a temporary string to store the results of the removal of backspaces. It is optimal because it removes all backspaces from the strings in the most efficient way possible, without creating any unnecessary copies of the strings.
