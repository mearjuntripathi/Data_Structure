# [496. Next Greater Element I](https://leetcode.com/problems/next-greater-element-i/)

The **next greater element** of some element `x` in an array is the **first greater** element that is **to the right of** `x` in the same array.

You are given two **distinct 0-indexed** integer arrays nums1 and `nums2`, where `nums1` is a subset of `nums2`.

For each `0 <= i < nums1.length`, find the index `j` such that `nums1[i] == nums2[j]` and determine the next greater element of `nums2[j]` in `nums2`. If there is no next greater element, then the answer for this query is `-1`.

Return an array `ans` of length `nums1.length` such that `ans[i]` is the next greater element as described above.

 

**Example 1:**

> Input: nums1 = [4,1,2], nums2 = [1,3,4,2]<br>
> Output: [-1,3,-1]<br>
> Explanation: The next greater element for each value of nums1 is as follows:<br>
> - 4 is underlined in nums2 = [1,3,4,2]. There is no next greater element, so the answer is -1.<br>
> - 1 is underlined in nums2 = [1,3,4,2]. The next greater element is 3.<br>
> - 2 is underlined in nums2 = [1,3,4,2]. There is no next greater element, so the answer is -1.

**Example 2:**

> Input: nums1 = [2,4], nums2 = [1,2,3,4]<br>
> Output: [3,-1]<br>
> Explanation: The next greater element for each value of nums1 is as follows:<br>
> - 2 is underlined in nums2 = [1,2,3,4]. The next greater element is 3.<br>
> - 4 is underlined in nums2 = [1,2,3,4]. There is no next greater element, so the answer is -1.
 

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= nums1.length <= nums2.length <= 1000`
* `0 <= nums1[i], nums2[i] <= 104`
* All integers in `nums1` and `nums2` are unique.
* All the integers of `nums1` also appear in `nums2`.

## Solution

**Brute Force Approach**

1. Initialize a vector `ans` of size `nums1.size()`.
2. For each index `i` in `nums1`:
    * Initialize a flag `found` to False.
    * Iterate through `nums2` starting from index `0`:
        * If `nums1[i] == nums2[j]`:
            * Set `found` to True.
        * If `found` is True and `nums2[j] > nums1[i]`:
            * Set `ans[i] = nums2[j]` and break.
    * If `found` is False, set `ans[i] = -1`.
3. Return `ans`.

Code in CPP

    vector<int> nextGreaterElement(vector<int>& nums1, vector<int>& nums2) {
        vector<int>ans(nums1.size(),-1);
        for(int i=0;i<nums1.size();i++){
            int bools=false;
            for(int j=0;j<nums2.size();j++){
                if(nums1[i]==nums2[j]){bools=true;}
                if(bools && nums2[j]>nums1[i]){ans[i]=nums2[j];break;}
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }


**Here is an explanation of the algorithm:**

1. The first step initializes the vector `ans` to store the next greater element for each element in `nums1`.
2. The second step iterates through the elements in `nums1`.
3. The third step iterates through the elements in `nums2`.
4. If the current element in `nums1` is found in `nums2`, then we set the flag `found` to True.
5. If `found` is True and the current element in `nums2` is greater than the current element in `nums1`, then we set the value of `ans[i]` to the current element in `nums2` and break.
6. If `found` is False, then we set the value of `ans[i]` to -1.
7. The third step terminates when all elements in `nums1` have been processed.

This algorithm is a brute force solution because it checks every possible element in `nums2` to find the next greater element for each element in `nums1`. It is not very efficient, but it is simple to implement.

The time complexity of this algorithm is O(m * n), where m is the size of `nums1` and n is the size of `nums2`. The space complexity of this algorithm is O(m), since it uses a vector of size `m` to store the next greater element for each element in `nums1`.

**Optimal Approach**

1. Initialize a stack `st` and an empty hash map `mp`.
2. Push the last element of `nums2` to `st`.
3. Add the last element of `nums2` to `mp` with a value of -1.
4. Iterate through the elements of `nums2` from the second last element to the first element:
    * While the stack is not empty and the top element of the stack is less than the current element:
        * Pop the top element from the stack.
    * Add the current element to `mp` with a value of the top element of the stack (or -1 if the stack is empty).
    * Push the current element to the stack.
5. Iterate through the elements of `nums1`:
    * Set the current element of `nums1` to the value stored in `mp` for that element.
6. Return `nums1`.

Code in CPP

    vector<int> nextGreaterElement(vector<int>& nums1, vector<int>& nums2) {
        stack<int> st;
        int n2 = nums2.size()-1;
        st.push(nums2[n2]);
        
        unordered_map<int,int> mp;
        mp[nums2[n2]] = -1;

        for(int i = n2-1 ; i >= 0 ; i--){
            while(!st.empty() && st.top() < nums2[i]){
                st.pop();
            }
            mp[nums2[i]] = st.empty() ? -1 : st.top();
            st.push(nums2[i]);
        }

        for(int i = 0 ; i < nums1.size() ; i++)
            nums1[i] = mp[nums1[i]]; 

        return nums1;
    }

**Here is an explanation of the algorithm:**

* The first step, initializing `st` and `mp`, is necessary to create the data structures that will be used to store the next greater elements.
* The second step, pushing the last element of `nums2` to `st`, is necessary to initialize the stack.
* The third step, adding the last element of `nums2` to `mp` with a value of -1, is necessary to indicate that there is no next greater element for the last element.
* The fourth step, iterating through the elements of `nums2` from the second last element to the first element, is where the actual next greater element calculation takes place. We iterate through the elements in reverse order so that we can easily pop the top element of the stack and compare it to the current element.
* The fifth step, adding the current element to `mp` with a value of the top element of the stack (or -1 if the stack is empty), is necessary to store the next greater element for the current element.
* The sixth step, pushing the current element to the stack, is necessary to keep track of the next greater elements for the subsequent elements.
* The seventh step, iterating through the elements of `nums1`, is where we set the values of the elements in `nums1` to the next greater elements stored in `mp`.
* The eighth step, returning `nums1`, is necessary to return the vector with the next greater elements.
