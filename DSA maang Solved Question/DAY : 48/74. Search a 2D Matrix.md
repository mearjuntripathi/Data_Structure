# [74. Search a 2D Matrix](https://leetcode.com/problems/search-a-2d-matrix/)

You are given an `m x n` integer matrix `matrix` with the following two properties:

- Each row is sorted in non-decreasing order.
- The first integer of each row is greater than the last integer of the previous row.

Given an integer `target`, return `true` if `target` is in `matrix` or `false` otherwise.

You must write a solution in `O(log(m * n))` time complexity.

**Example 1:**

>**Input:** matrix = [[1,3,5,7],[10,11,16,20],[23,30,34,60]], target = 3<br>
**Output:** true

**Example 2:**

>**Input:** matrix = [[1,3,5,7],[10,11,16,20],[23,30,34,60]], target = 13<br>
**Output:** false

**Constraints:**

- `m == matrix.length`
- `n == matrix[i].length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 100`
- `-1e4 <= matrix[i][j], target <= 1e4`

# Solution

### Approach

The approach used in this solution is binary search. Binary search works by repeatedly dividing the search space in half until the target element is found or the search space is exhausted. In this case, the search space is a two-dimensional array, which can be thought of as a vector of vectors.

### Algorithm

The algorithm for this solution is as follows:

1. Initialize two pointers, `low` and `high`, to the beginning and end of the search space, respectively.
2. While `low` is less than or equal to `high`:
    * Compute the middle element of the search space, `mid`.
    * Compute the row and column of the middle element, `r` and `c`, respectively.
    * If the target element is equal to the element at row `r` and column `c`, return `true`.
    * If the target element is less than the element at row `r` and column `c`, set `high` to `mid` minus 1.
    * Otherwise, set `low` to `mid` plus 1.
3. Return `false`, indicating that the target element was not found.

### C++ implementation

The following is a C++ implementation of the binary search algorithm for searching a two-dimensional array:

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    bool searchMatrix(vector<vector<int>>& matrix, int target) {
        int row = matrix.size();
        int col = matrix[0].size();
        int low = 0;
        int high = (row * col)-1;
        while(low <= high){
            int mid = low + (high-low)/2;
            int r = mid/col, c = mid%col;
            if(matrix[r][c] == target){
                return true;
            }
            if(matrix[r][c] > target){
                high = mid - 1;
            }else{
                low = mid + 1;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
};
```

### Example usage

The following example shows how to use the `searchMatrix()` function:

```c++
vector<vector<int>> matrix = {{1, 3, 5, 7}, {10, 11, 16, 20}, {23, 30, 34, 50}};
int target = 16;

Solution solution;
bool found = solution.searchMatrix(matrix, target);

if (found) {
    cout << "The target element was found." << endl;
} else {
    cout << "The target element was not found." << endl;
}
```

Output:

```
The target element was found.
```
