# [59. Spiral Matrix II](https://leetcode.com/problems/spiral-matrix-ii/)

Given a positive integer `n`, generate an `n x n` matrix filled with elements from `1` to `n62` in spiral order.

**Example 1:**

>**Input:** n = 3<br>
**Output:** [[1,2,3],[8,9,4],[7,6,5]]

**Example 2:**

>**Input:** n = 1<br>
**Output:** [[1]]

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= n <= 20`

# Solution

**Approach**

The approach used in this C++ solution is to iteratively fill the matrix in a spiral pattern, starting from the top left corner. At each step, we move one row down, one column to the right, one row up, and one column to the left. We keep track of the current row and column using four variables: `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right`.

**Algorithm**

1. Initialize the matrix to all zeros.
2. Set the current row and column to the top left corner.
3. Fill the current row with increasing values, starting from 1.
4. Move down one row.
5. Fill the current column with increasing values, starting from the value that was just filled in the previous row.
6. Move right one column.
7. Fill the current row with decreasing values, starting from the value that was just filled in the previous column.
8. Move up one row.
9. Fill the current column with decreasing values, starting from the value that was just filled in the previous row.
10. Move left one column.
11. Repeat steps 4-9 until the current row and column are outside of the matrix bounds.

**Example**

Here is an example of how the algorithm would be used to generate a 3x3 matrix:

```c++
vector<vector<int>> matrix(3, vector<int>(3, 0));

int top = 0;
int bottom = 2;
int left = 0;
int right = 2;
int value = 1;

while (top <= bottom && left <= right) {
  for (int i = left; i <= right; i++) {
    matrix[top][i] = value++;
  }
  top++;

  for (int i = top; i <= bottom; i++) {
    matrix[i][right] = value++;
  }
  right--;

  if (top <= bottom) {
    for (int i = right; i >= left; i--) {
      matrix[bottom][i] = value++;
    }
    bottom--;
  }

  if (left <= right) {
    for (int i = bottom; i >= top; i--) {
      matrix[i][left] = value++;
    }
    left++;
  }
}
```

The resulting matrix would be:

```
1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9
```
