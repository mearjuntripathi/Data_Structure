# [240. Search a 2D Matrix II](https://leetcode.com/problems/search-a-2d-matrix-ii/)

Write an efficient algorithm that searches for a value target in an `m x n` integer matrix `matrix`. This matrix has the following properties:

- Integers in each row are sorted in ascending from left to right.
- Integers in each column are sorted in ascending from top to bottom.

**Example 1:**

>**Input:** matrix = [[1,4,7,11,15],[2,5,8,12,19],[3,6,9,16,22],[10,13,14,17,24],[18,21,23,26,30]], target = 5<br>
**Output:** true

**Example 2:**

>**Input:** matrix = [[1,4,7,11,15],[2,5,8,12,19],[3,6,9,16,22],[10,13,14,17,24],[18,21,23,26,30]], target = 20<br>
**Output:** false
 

**Constraints:**

- `m == matrix.length`
- `n == matrix[i].length`
- `1 <= n, m <= 300`
- `-1e9 <= matrix[i][j] <= 1e9`
- All the integers in each row are sorted in ascending order.
- All the integers in each column are sorted in ascending order.
- `-1e9 <= target <= 1e9`

# Solution

The approach taken by the `searchMatrix()` solution in C++ is to use a binary search algorithm. The binary search algorithm works by repeatedly dividing the search space in half until the target element is found or the search space is empty.

In this case, the search space is the matrix itself. The algorithm starts by comparing the target element to the element at the center of the matrix. If the target element is equal to the center element, then the algorithm returns true. Otherwise, the algorithm eliminates the half of the matrix that cannot contain the target element and repeats the process on the remaining half.

The algorithm terminates when it either finds the target element or the search space is empty. If the search space is empty, then the algorithm returns false, indicating that the target element is not present in the matrix.

Here is a more detailed algorithm for the `searchMatrix()` solution in C++:

1. Initialize two variables, `r` and `c`, to represent the current row and column indices.
2. While `r` is less than the number of rows in the matrix and `c` is greater than or equal to zero:
    * Compare the target element to the element at the current row and column indices.
    * If the target element is equal to the current element, then return true.
    * If the target element is greater than the current element, then increment `r`.
    * If the target element is less than the current element, then decrement `c`.
3. If the algorithm reaches this point, then the target element was not found in the matrix. Return false.

Here is an example of how to use the `searchMatrix()` solution in C++:

```c++
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    bool searchMatrix(vector<vector<int>>& matrix, const int &target) {
        int row = matrix.size();
        int col = matrix[0].size();

        int r = 0;
        int c = col-1;
        while(r < row && c >= 0){
            if(matrix[r][c] == target)
                return true;
            matrix[r][c] > target ? c-- : r++;
        }
        return false;
    }
};

int main() {
    vector<vector<int>> matrix = {{1, 3, 5, 7}, {10, 11, 16, 20}, {23, 30, 34, 50}};
    int target = 16;

    Solution solution;
    bool found = solution.searchMatrix(matrix, target);

    if (found) {
        cout << "The target element was found in the matrix." << endl;
    } else {
        cout << "The target element was not found in the matrix." << endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

Output:

```
The target element was found in the matrix.
```
