# [1539. Kth Missing Positive Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/kth-missing-positive-number/)

The code I provided has two approaches to solving the problem of finding the k-th positive integer that is not present in an unsorted array of positive integers:

**Brute force approach:**

1. Iterate over the array and keep track of the current value of k.
2. For each element in the array, check if it is less than or equal to k.
    * If it is, increment k.
    * Otherwise, break the loop.
3. Return k.

**Binary search approach:**

1. Initialize two pointers, low and high, to the beginning and end of the array, respectively.
2. While low is less than or equal to high:
    * Calculate the middle index, mid, of the array.
    * Calculate the number of missing elements up to index mid, missing = arr[mid] - (mid + 1).
    * If missing is less than k, set low to mid + 1.
    * Otherwise, set high to mid - 1.
3. Return k + high + 1.

**Algorithm:**

```cpp
int findKthPositive(vector<int>& arr, int k) {
    // brute force approach

    for(int i = 0 ; i < arr.size() ; i++){
        if(arr[i] <= k)
            k++;
        else break;
    }
    return k;
}
```

**Brute force approach:**
```cpp
int findKthPositive(vector<int>& arr, int k) {
    // Binary search approach

    int low = 0 , high = arr.size()-1;

    while(low<=high){
        int mid = low + (high-low)/2;
        int missing = arr[mid] - (mid+1);

        if(missing < k)
            low = mid+1;
        else high = mid - 1;
    }
    
    return k + high + 1;
}
```

```
1. Initialize a variable k to 1.
2. Iterate over the array arr:
    * If arr[i] <= k:
        * Increment k.
    * Otherwise, break the loop.
3. Return k.
```

**Binary search approach:**

```
1. Initialize two variables low and high to 0 and arr.size() - 1, respectively.
2. While low <= high:
    * Calculate the middle index, mid, of the array.
    * Calculate the number of missing elements up to index mid, missing = arr[mid] - (mid + 1).
    * If missing < k:
        * Set low to mid + 1.
    * Otherwise, set high to mid - 1.
3. Return k + high + 1.
```

**Example:**

```
Input: arr = [2, 3, 5, 9, 10], k = 4
Output: 7

Explanation:
The missing positive integers are 1, 4, 6, and 7.
The 4th missing positive integer is 7.
```

The binary search approach is more efficient than the brute force approach, especially for large arrays.
