# [367. Valid Perfect Square](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-perfect-square/)

Given a positive integer num, return `true` if `num` is a perfect square or `false` otherwise.

A perfect square is an integer that is the square of an integer. In other words, it is the product of some integer with itself.

You must not use any built-in library function, such as `sqrt`.

**Example 1:**

> **Input:** num = 16<br>
**Output:** true<br>
**Explanation:** We return true because 4 * 4 = 16 and 4 is an integer.

**Example 2:**

> **Input:** num = 14<br>
**Output:** false<br>
**Explanation:** We return false because 3.742 * 3.742 = 14 and 3.742 is not an integer.
 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= num <= 231 - 1`

# Solution

The `isPerfectSquare()` function you provided uses a binary search algorithm to determine if a given integer `num` is a perfect square.

**Approach**

The binary search algorithm works by repeatedly dividing the search space in half until the target element is found or the search space is empty. In this case, the search space is the range of integers from 1 to `num/2`.

The algorithm begins by setting the start pointer (`s`) to 1 and the end pointer (`e`) to `num/2`. Then, it calculates the midpoint (`mid`) of the search space. If `mid` is a perfect square, then the algorithm returns `true`. Otherwise, the algorithm compares `mid` to `num`. If `mid` is greater than `num`, then the algorithm updates the end pointer (`e`) to `mid - 1`. Otherwise, the algorithm updates the start pointer (`s`) to `mid + 1`.

The algorithm terminates when the start pointer (`s`) is greater than the end pointer (`e`). If the algorithm terminates without finding a perfect square, then it returns `false`.

**Algorithm**

```cpp
bool isPerfectSquare(int num) {
    if (num == 1) {
        return true;
    }
    int s = 1, e = num / 2;
    while (s <= e) {
        long long mid = s + (e - s) / 2;
        if (mid * mid == num) {
            return true;
        }
        if (mid * mid > num) {
            e = mid - 1;
        } else {
            s = mid + 1;
        }
    }
    return false;
}
```

**Example**

```cpp
int num = 16;

bool isPerfectSquare = isPerfectSquare(num);

if (isPerfectSquare) {
    cout << num << " is a perfect square." << endl;
} else {
    cout << num << " is not a perfect square." << endl;
}
```

Output:

```
16 is a perfect square.
```

The time complexity of the `isPerfectSquare()` function is O(log(n)), where n is the input integer. This is because the binary search algorithm divides the search space in half at each iteration.
