# [35. Search Insert Position](https://leetcode.com/problems/search-insert-position/)

Given a sorted array of distinct integers and a target value, return the index if the target is found. If not, return the index where it would be if it were inserted in order.

You must write an algorithm with `O(log n)` runtime complexity.

 

**Example 1:**

> **Input:** nums = [1,3,5,6], target = 5<br>
**Output:** 2

**Example 2:**

> **Input:** nums = [1,3,5,6], target = 2<br>
**Output:** 1

**Example 3:**

> **Input:** nums = [1,3,5,6], target = 7<br>
**Output:** 4
 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 104`
- `-104 <= nums[i] <= 104`
- `nums` contains distinct values sorted in ascending order.
- `-104 <= target <= 104`

# Solution

The code I provided implements a binary search algorithm to find the insertion position of a target value in a sorted vector. The algorithm works by repeatedly dividing the search space in half until the target value is found or the search space is empty.

**Approach**

The algorithm works by maintaining two indices, `s` and `e`, which represent the start and end of the current search space. The algorithm starts by setting `s` to zero and `e` to the size of the vector minus one. Then, the algorithm repeatedly performs the following steps:

1. Calculate the middle index of the search space, `mid` = `s` + (`e` - `s`) / 2.
2. If `nums[mid]` is equal to the target value, then the algorithm returns `mid`.
3. If `nums[mid]` is greater than the target value, then the algorithm sets `e` to `mid` - 1.
4. If `nums[mid]` is less than the target value, then the algorithm sets `s` to `mid` + 1.

The algorithm stops when `s` and `e` are equal, which means that the search space is empty and the target value was not found. In this case, the algorithm returns `-1`.

**Algorithm**

```cpp
int searchInsert(vector<int>& nums, int target) {
    int s = 0;
    int e = nums.size()-1;
    while(s<=e){
        if(nums[s] >= target)
            return s;
        if(nums[e] <= target)
            return nums[e]<target ? e+1 : e;
        int mid = s + (e-s)/2;
        if(nums[mid] == target)
            return mid;
        if(nums[mid] > target)
            e = mid-1;
        else s = mid + 1;
    }
    return -1;
}
```

**Example**

```cpp
vector<int> nums = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9};
int target = 4;

int insertionPosition = searchInsert(nums, target);

printf("The insertion position of %d in the vector is %d.\n", target, insertionPosition);
```

Output:

```
The insertion position of 4 in the vector is 1.
```
