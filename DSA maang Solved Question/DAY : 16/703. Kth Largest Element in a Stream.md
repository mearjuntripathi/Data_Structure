# [703. Kth Largest Element in a Stream](https://leetcode.com/problems/kth-largest-element-in-a-stream/)

Design a class to find the `kth` largest element in a stream. Note that it is the `kth` largest element in the sorted order, not the `kth` distinct element.

Implement KthLargest class:

- `KthLargest(int k, int[] nums)` Initializes the object with the integer `k` and the stream of integers `nums`.
- `int add(int val)` Appends the integer `val` to the stream and returns the element representing the `kth` largest element in the stream.
 

**Example 1:**

> **Input**<br>
["KthLargest", "add", "add", "add", "add", "add"]<br>
[[3, [4, 5, 8, 2]], [3], [5], [10], [9], [4]]<br>
**Output**<br>
[null, 4, 5, 5, 8, 8]<br>
**Explanation**
KthLargest kthLargest = new KthLargest(3, [4, 5, 8, 2]);<br>
kthLargest.add(3);   // return 4<br>
kthLargest.add(5);   // return 5<br>
kthLargest.add(10);  // return 5<br>
kthLargest.add(9);   // return 8<br>
kthLargest.add(4);   // return 8
 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= k <= 104`
- `0 <= nums.length <= 104`
- `-104 <= nums[i] <= 104`
- `-104 <= val <= 104`
- At most `10^4` calls will be made to `add`.
- It is guaranteed that there will be at least k elements in the array when you search for the `kth` element.

# Solution

## A Brute Force Approach

The brute force approach to the `KthLargest` class is to use a sorted array to store the `k` largest elements. When a new element is added, the array is sorted again to maintain the correct order.

Here is a more detailed explanation of the algorithm:

1. The constructor initializes the `arr` array to the sorted input `nums` array.
2. The `add()` method takes a new element `val` as input.
3. If the `arr` array is already full and `val` is greater than the smallest element in the array, then the smallest element is removed and `val` is inserted in its place.
4. Otherwise, `val` is simply appended to the end of the array.
5. The `add()` method then returns the `k`th largest element in the array.

Here is a step-by-step example of how the `add()` method works:

```
Input: nums = [4, 5, 1, 2, 3], k = 3, val = 6

1. arr = nums = [4, 5, 1, 2, 3]
2. Since arr.size() < k, val is appended to the end of the array.
3. arr = [4, 5, 1, 2, 3, 6]
4. The 3rd largest element in the array is 6.
```

The time complexity of the `add()` method is O(n log n), where `n` is the size of the `arr` array. This is because the array is sorted every time a new element is added. The space complexity of the `KthLargest` class is O(k), since the `arr` array must store the `k` largest elements.

## Pros and Cons of the Brute Force Approach

The following are the pros and cons of the brute force approach to the `KthLargest` class:

**Pros:**

* Simple to understand and implement.
* Works for all inputs.

**Cons:**

* Inefficient for large arrays.
* Requires O(k) space to store the `k` largest elements.

## Conclusion

The brute force approach to the `KthLargest` class is a simple and straightforward way to solve the problem. However, it is inefficient for large arrays. There are more efficient algorithms for solving this problem, such as using a priority queue.

Here is a C++ code example of the brute force approach to the `KthLargest` class:

```c++
class KthLargest {
public:
    KthLargest(int k, vector<int>& nums) {
        this->k = k;
        this->arr = nums;
        sort(arr.begin(), arr.end());
    }

    int add(int val) {
        if (arr.size() < k || val > arr[arr.size() - k]) {
            int low = 0;
            int high = arr.size() - 1;
            while (low <= high) {
                int mid = low + (high - low) / 2;
                if (val < arr[mid])
                    high = mid - 1;
                else
                    low = mid + 1;
            }
            arr.insert(arr.begin() + low, val);
        }
        return arr[arr.size() - k];
    }

private:
    int k;
    vector<int> arr;
};
```

This code is very similar to the Python code example, except that it uses C++ vectors and iterators instead of Python lists.

Here is an example of how to use the `KthLargest` class in C++:

```c++
int main() {
    vector<int> nums = {4, 5, 1, 2, 3};
    KthLargest kth_largest(3, nums);

    // Add a new element to the array.
    kth_largest.add(6);

    // Get the 3rd largest element in the array.
    int largest_element = kth_largest.add(7);

    // Print the largest element.
    cout << largest_element << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

Output:

```
6
```

## Heap Approach

The approach of the code you provided is to use a min-heap to store the `k` largest elements. A min-heap is a data structure that always returns the smallest element when popped.

The algorithm works as follows:

1. The constructor initializes the `minHeap` to an empty min-heap.
2. For each element `num` in the input array `nums`, the `add()` method is called.
3. The `add()` method checks the size of the `minHeap`. If the `minHeap` is smaller than `k`, then `val` is simply appended to the `minHeap`.
4. Otherwise, `val` is compared to the top element of the `minHeap`. If `val` is greater than the top element, then the top element is popped and `val` is inserted into the `minHeap`.
5. The `add()` method then returns the top element of the `minHeap`, which is the `k`th largest element.

Here is a step-by-step example of how the `add()` method works:

```cpp
class KthLargest {
    int k;
    std::priority_queue<int, std::vector<int>, std::greater<int>> minHeap;

public:
    KthLargest(int k, vector<int>& nums) {
        this->k = k;
        for (int num : nums) {
            add(num);
        }
    }

    int add(int val) {
        if (minHeap.size() < k) {
            minHeap.push(val);
        } else if (val > minHeap.top()) {
            minHeap.pop();
            minHeap.push(val);
        }
        return minHeap.top();
    }
};
```

```
Input: nums = [4, 5, 1, 2, 3], k = 3, val = 6

1. minHeap = []
2. add(4)
3. minHeap = [4]
4. add(5)
5. minHeap = [4, 5]
6. add(1)
7. minHeap = [1, 4, 5]
8. add(2)
9. minHeap = [1, 2, 5]
10. add(3)
11. minHeap = [1, 2, 3, 5]
12. add(6)
13. minHeap = [1, 2, 3, 6]
14. Return the top element of the minHeap, which is 6.
```

## Pros and Cons of the Priority Queue Approach

The following are the pros and cons of the priority queue approach to the `KthLargest` class:

**Pros:**

* More efficient than the brute force approach for large arrays.
* Only requires O(k) space to store the `k` largest elements.

**Cons:**

* More complex to understand and implement than the brute force approach.

## Conclusion

The priority queue approach to the `KthLargest` class is a more efficient way to solve the problem than the brute force approach, especially for large arrays. However, it is also more complex to understand and implement.
