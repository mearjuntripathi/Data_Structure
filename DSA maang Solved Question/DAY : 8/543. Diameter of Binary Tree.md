# [543. Diameter of Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/diameter-of-binary-tree/)

Given the `root` of a binary tree, return the length of the diameter of the tree.

The diameter of a binary tree is the length of the longest path between any two nodes in a tree. This path may or may not pass through the `root`.

The **length** of a path between two nodes is represented by the number of edges between them.

**Example 1:**

>**Input:** root = [1,2,3,4,5]<br>
>**Output:** 3 <br>
> **Explanation:** 3 is the length of the path [4,2,1,3] or [5,2,1,3].

**Example 2:**

>**Input:** root = [1,2]<br>
>**Output:** 1
 

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 104]`.
- `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`

## Solution

The diameter of a binary tree is the length of the longest path between any two nodes in the tree. The path can be either a direct path or a path that goes through the root node.

The approach of the code is to use a recursive function `check()`. The function takes the root node of the tree and the current diameter as its arguments. The function first checks if the root node is null. If it is, then it returns 0. Otherwise, it calls the function recursively on the left and right subtrees of the root node. The function then updates the current diameter to the maximum of the current diameter and the sum of the lengths of the longest paths from the left and right subtrees to the root node. Finally, the function returns 1 plus the maximum of the lengths of the longest paths from the left and right subtrees to the root node.

The algorithm of the code is as follows:

1. Initialize the current diameter to 0.
2. Call the `check()` function on the root node of the tree.
3. Return the current diameter.

The time complexity of the code is O(n^2), where n is the number of nodes in the tree. The space complexity of the code is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree.

Here is a brief explanation of each line of code:

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int check(TreeNode* root, int &diameter){
        if(root == NULL)
            return 0;
        int lh = check(root->left,diameter);
        int rh = check(root->right,diameter);
        diameter = max(diameter, lh+rh);
        return 1 + max(lh,rh);
    }
    int diameterOfBinaryTree(TreeNode* root) {

        int diameter = 0;
        check(root,diameter);
        return diameter;
    }
};
```

* Line 1: The `class Solution` declares a class called `Solution`.
* Line 2: The `public` keyword makes the functions `check()` and `diameterOfBinaryTree()` accessible from outside the class.
* Line 3: The `int check(TreeNode* root, int &diameter)` function takes the root node of the tree and the current diameter as its arguments.
* Line 4: The `if(root == NULL)` statement checks if the root node is null. If it is, then the function returns 0.
* Line 5: The `int lh = check(root->left,diameter)` statement calls the `check()` function recursively on the left subtree of the root node.
* Line 6: The `int rh = check(root->right,diameter)` statement calls the `check()` function recursively on the right subtree of the root node.
* Line 7: The `diameter = max(diameter, lh+rh)` statement updates the current diameter to the maximum of the current diameter and the sum of the lengths of the longest paths from the left and right subtrees to the root node.
* Line 8: The `return 1 + max(lh,rh)` statement returns 1 plus the maximum of the lengths of the longest paths from the left and right subtrees to the root node.
* Line 9: The `int diameterOfBinaryTree(TreeNode* root)` function takes the root node of the tree as its argument.
* Line 10: The `int diameter = 0` statement initializes the current diameter to 0.
* Line 11: The `check(root,diameter)` statement calls the `check()` function on the root node of the tree.
* Line 12: The `return diameter` statement returns the current diameter.
