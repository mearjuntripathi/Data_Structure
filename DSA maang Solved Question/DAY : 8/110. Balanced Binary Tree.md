Given a binary tree, determine if it is 
<a href=" " title="Height-Balanced
A height-balanced binary tree is a binary tree in which the depth of the two subtrees of every node never differs by more than one.">height-balanced </a>.

 

**Example 1:**

> **Input:** root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]<br>
> **Output:** true

**Example 2:**

> **Input:** root = [1,2,2,3,3,null,null,4,4]<br>
> **Output:** false

**Example 3:**

> **Input:** root = []<br>
> **Output:** true
 

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 5000]`.
- `-104 <= Node.val <= 104`

## Solution

A balanced binary tree is a binary tree where the difference between the heights of the left and right subtrees of any node is not more than 1.
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int check(TreeNode *root){
        if(root == NULL)
            return 0;
        
        int l = check(root->left);
        if(l == -1)
            return l;
        int r = check(root->right);
        if(r == -1)
            return r;
        if(abs(l-r) > 1)
            return -1;
        return max(l,r)+1;
    } 

    bool isBalanced(TreeNode* root) {
        if(root == NULL)
            return true;
        
        return check(root) == -1 ? false : true;
    }
};
```
**The approach of the code is as follows:**

1. The `check()` function recursively checks if the left and right subtrees of the given node are balanced.
2. If either of the subtrees is not balanced, the function returns -1.
3. If both subtrees are balanced, the function returns the maximum of the heights of the left and right subtrees plus 1.
4. The `isBalanced()` function checks if the given tree is balanced by calling the `check()` function on the root node.

**The algorithm of the code is as follows:**

1. Initialize a variable `height` to 0.
2. Call the `check()` function on the root node and store the result in `height`.
3. If `height` is -1, then the tree is not balanced.
4. Otherwise, the tree is balanced.

**Here is a step-by-step explanation of how the code works:**

1. The `check()` function is called on the root node.
2. The `check()` function recursively calls itself on the left and right subtrees of the root node.
3. The `check()` function returns -1 if either of the subtrees is not balanced.
4. The `check()` function returns the maximum of the heights of the left and right subtrees plus 1 if both subtrees are balanced.
5. The `isBalanced()` function calls the `check()` function on the root node and stores the result in `height`.
6. If `height` is -1, then the tree is not balanced and the function returns false.
7. Otherwise, the tree is balanced and the function returns true.
