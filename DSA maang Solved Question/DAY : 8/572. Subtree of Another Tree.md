# [572. Subtree of Another Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/subtree-of-another-tree/)

Given the roots of two binary trees `root` and `subRoot`, return `true` if there is a subtree of `root` with the same structure and node values of `subRoot` and `false` otherwise.

A subtree of a binary tree `tree` is a tree that consists of a node in `tree` and all of this node's descendants. The tree `tree` could also be considered as a subtree of itself. 

**Example 1:**

> **Input:** root = [3,4,5,1,2], subRoot = [4,1,2]<br>
> **Output:** true

**Example 2:**
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/04/28/subtree2-tree.jpg)

> **Input:** root = [3,4,5,1,2,null,null,null,null,0], subRoot = [4,1,2]<br>
> **Output:** false
 

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the root tree is in the range `[1, 2000]`.
- The number of nodes in the subRoot tree is in the range `[1, 1000]`.
- `-104 <= root.val <= 104`
- `-104 <= subRoot.val <= 104`

## Solution

The code i have given implements the recursive function `isSubtree()`, which takes two TreeNode objects as input: the root of a binary tree and the root of a subtree. The function returns `true` if the subtree is a subtree of the binary tree, and `false` otherwise.

The function works by first checking if both trees are empty. If they are, then the subtree is a subtree of the binary tree (since any empty tree is a subtree of any other tree).

If either tree is not empty, then the function checks if the value of the root of the binary tree is equal to the value of the root of the subtree. If they are not equal, then the subtree is not a subtree of the binary tree.

If the values of the roots are equal, then the function recursively calls itself on the left subtree of the binary tree and the left subtree of the subtree. If either of these recursive calls returns `true`, then the function returns `true`.

Finally, the function recursively calls itself on the right subtree of the binary tree and the right subtree of the subtree. If either of these recursive calls returns `true`, then the function returns `true`.

In other words, the function recursively checks if the left subtree and the right subtree of the binary tree are subtrees of the subtree. If both of these checks return `true`, then the function returns `true`.

```cpp
class Solution {
    bool match(TreeNode* root, TreeNode *subRoot){
        if(!root && !subRoot)
            return true;
        
        if(!root || !subRoot)
            return false;
        
        return (root->val == subRoot->val) &&
               (match(root->left, subRoot->left) && match(root->right, subRoot->right));
    }
public:
    bool isSubtree(TreeNode* root, TreeNode* subRoot) {
        if(!root)
            return false;
        if(match(root,subRoot)) return true;

        return isSubtree(root->left, subRoot) || isSubtree(root->right, subRoot);
    }
};
```

The approach used by this code is called the **divide and conquer** approach. This approach breaks the problem into smaller subproblems, solves each subproblem recursively, and then combines the solutions to the subproblems to solve the original problem.

The time complexity of this algorithm is O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the binary tree. The space complexity of this algorithm is O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the subtree.

**Here is a step-by-step explanation of how the algorithm works:**

1. The function is called with the root of the binary tree and the root of the subtree.
2. The function checks if both trees are empty. If they are, then the subtree is a subtree of the binary tree (since any empty tree is a subtree of any other tree).
3. If either tree is not empty, then the function checks if the value of the root of the binary tree is equal to the value of the root of the subtree. If they are not equal, then the subtree is not a subtree of the binary tree.
4. If the values of the roots are equal, then the function recursively calls itself on the left subtree of the binary tree and the left subtree of the subtree.
5. If either of these recursive calls returns `true`, then the function returns `true`.
6. Otherwise, the function recursively calls itself on the right subtree of the binary tree and the right subtree of the subtree.
7. If either of these recursive calls returns `true`, then the function returns `true`.
8. Otherwise, the function returns `false`.
