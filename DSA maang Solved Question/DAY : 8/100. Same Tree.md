# [100. Same Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/same-tree/)

Given the roots of two binary trees `p` and `q`, write a function to check if they are the same or not.

Two binary trees are considered the same if they are structurally identical, and the nodes have the same value.


**Example 1:**

> **Input:** p = [1,2,3], q = [1,2,3]<br>
> **Output:** true

**Example 2:**

> **Input:** p = [1,2], q = [1,null,2]<br>
> **Output:** false

**Example 3:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/12/20/ex3.jpg)

> **Input:** p = [1,2,1], q = [1,1,2]<br>
> **Output:** false
 

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in both trees is in the range `[0, 100]`.
- `-104 <= Node.val <= 104`

# Solution

Sure. The code you have provided is a recursive function that checks if two binary trees are the same. The approach is as follows:

1. Check if both trees are empty. If they are, then they are the same.
2. If one of the trees is empty but not the other, then they are not the same.
3. Check if the values of the root nodes of the two trees are equal. If they are not, then the trees are not the same.
4. Recursively check if the left subtrees of the two trees are the same and if the right subtrees of the two trees are the same. If all of these checks pass, then the two trees are the same.

Here is an explanation of the code:

```cpp
bool isSameTree(TreeNode* p, TreeNode* q) {
    if(!p && !q) return true;
    
    if(!p || !q) return false;

    if( p->val != q->val) return false;
    
    return isSameTree(p->left,q->left) && 
           isSameTree(p->right, q->right);
}
```

The first line checks if both trees are empty. If they are, then the function returns True. The second line checks if one of the trees is empty but not the other. If it is, then the function returns False. The third line checks if the values of the root nodes of the two trees are equal. If they are not, then the function returns False. The fourth line recursively calls the `isSameTree()` function on the left subtrees of the two trees. If the results of these recursive calls are both True, then the function returns True. Otherwise, the function returns False.
