# [617. Merge Two Binary Trees](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-two-binary-trees/)

You are given two binary trees `root1` and `root2`.

Imagine that when you put one of them to cover the other, some nodes of the two trees are overlapped while the others are not. You need to merge the two trees into a new binary tree. The merge rule is that if two nodes overlap, then sum node values up as the new value of the merged node. Otherwise, the NOT null node will be used as the node of the new tree.

Return the *merged tree*.

**Note**: The merging process must start from the root nodes of both trees.

 

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/02/05/merge.jpg)

> **Input:** root1 = [1,3,2,5], root2 = [2,1,3,null,4,null,7]<br>
> **Output:** [3,4,5,5,4,null,7]

**Example 2:**

> **Input:** root1 = [1], root2 = [1,2]<br>
> **Output:** [2,2]
 

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in both trees is in the range `[0, 2000]`.
- `-104 <= Node.val <= 104`

# Solution


The approach is as follows:

1. If either of the trees is empty, return the other tree.
2. Otherwise, add the values of the root nodes of the two trees and set that as the value of the root node of the new tree.
3. Recursively merge the left subtrees of the two trees.
4. Recursively merge the right subtrees of the two trees.
5. Return the new tree.

Here is an explanation of the code:

```cpp
TreeNode* mergeTrees(TreeNode* root1, TreeNode* root2) {
    if(!root1) return root2;

    if(!root2) return root1;
    
    root1->val += root2->val;
    
    root1->left = mergeTrees(root1->left,root2->left);
    root1->right = mergeTrees(root1->right, root2->right);
    
    return root1; 
}
```

The first line checks if either of the trees is empty. If so, it returns the other tree. Otherwise, it continues with the rest of the algorithm.

The second line adds the values of the root nodes of the two trees and sets that as the value of the root node of the new tree.

The third and fourth lines recursively merge the left and right subtrees of the two trees, respectively.

The fifth line returns the new tree.
