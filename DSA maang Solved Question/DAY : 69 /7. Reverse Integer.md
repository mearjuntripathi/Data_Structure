## [7. Reverse Integer](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-integer/)

Given a signed 32-bit integer `x`, return `x` with its digits reversed. If reversing x causes the value to go outside the signed 32-bit integer range `[-231, 231 - 1]`, then return `0`.

Assume the environment does not allow you to store 64-bit integers (signed or unsigned).

**Example 1:**

>**Input:** x = 123<br>
**Output:** 321

**Example 2:**

>**Input:** x = -123<br>
**Output:** -321

**Example 3:**

>**Input:** x = 120<br>
**Output:** 21

**Constraints:**

- `-2^31 <= x <= 2^31 - 1`

# Solution
Sure, here is an approach and algorithm for the solution to reverse an integer in C++:

## Approach

The approach to reverse an integer in C++ is to repeatedly extract the least significant digit (LSD) of the integer, add it to a reversed integer variable, and divide the integer by 10. This process is continued until the integer is zero.

## Algorithm

The algorithm for reversing an integer in C++ is as follows:

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int reverse(int x) {
        long res = 0;
        while (x) {
            res *= 10;
            res += x % 10;
            if (res > INT_MAX || res < INT_MIN) return 0;
            x /= 10;
        }
        return int(res);
    }
};
```

## Explanation

The algorithm starts by initializing a `long` variable `res` to 0. This variable will be used to store the reversed integer. The `while` loop continues as long as the integer `x` is not zero. Inside the loop, the `x % 10` expression extracts the LSD of the integer `x`. This digit is then added to the `res` variable, and the `x` variable is divided by 10. This process effectively shifts the remaining digits of `x` to the left by one position.

The `if` statement inside the loop checks if the value of `res` has exceeded the maximum or minimum value of an `int`. If so, the function returns 0 to indicate that the reversed integer cannot be stored in an `int`.

Finally, the algorithm returns the value of the `res` variable, which is the reversed integer.

## Complexity

The time complexity of the algorithm is O(log n), where n is the absolute value of the input integer. This is because the algorithm performs approximately log n iterations of the while loop. The space complexity of the algorithm is O(1), as it only uses a constant amount of memory, regardless of the input integer.

I hope this helps!
