# [50. Pow(x, n)](https://leetcode.com/problems/powx-n/)

Implement `pow(x, n)`, which calculates x raised to the power `n` (i.e., `xn`).

**Example 1:**

>**Input:** x = 2.00000, n = 10<br>
**Output:** 1024.00000

**Example 2:**

>**Input:** x = 2.10000, n = 3<br>
**Output:** 9.26100

**Example 3:**

>**Input:** x = 2.00000, n = -2<br>
**Output:** 0.25000<br>
**Explanation:** 2-2 = 1/22 = 1/4 = 0.25
 

Constraints:

- `-100.0 < x < 100.0`
- `-2^31 <= n <= 2^31-1`
- `n` is an integer.
- Either `x` is not zero or `n > 0`.
- `-1e4 <= xn <= 1e4`

# Solution

Sure, here is an approach and algorithm for the given solution in C++:

**Approach:**

The approach taken in this solution is to repeatedly multiply the base by itself for each positive power of the exponent. For negative powers, the inverse of the product is calculated. This approach is based on the property that `(x^a)^b = x^(a*b)`.

**Algorithm:**

The algorithm can be broken down into the following steps:

1. Check if the exponent is negative. If it is, negate it and set the result to 1.
2. Initialize a variable `ans` to 1.
3. While the exponent is not zero:
    a. If the exponent is odd, multiply `ans` by the base and decrement the exponent.
    b. Otherwise, square the base and divide the exponent by 2.
4. If the original exponent was negative, divide `ans` by the base.
5. Return the result.

**Code:**

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    double myPow(double x, int n) {
        double ans = 1.0;
        long long nn = n;
        
        if(nn <0) 
            nn = -1 * nn;

        while(nn)
        {
            if(nn%2)
            {
                ans *= x;
                nn--;
            }
            else
            {
                x *= x;
                nn /= 2;
            }
        }
        if(n < 0) 
            ans = (double) (1.0)/(double)(ans);

        return ans;
    }
};
```

**Explanation:**

The code implements the algorithm described above. The `if` statement at the beginning of the code checks if the exponent is negative. If it is, the exponent is negated and the result is set to 1. This is because the inverse of a power is equal to the power with a negative exponent.

The `while` loop iterates as long as the exponent is not zero. Inside the loop, the `if` statement checks if the exponent is odd. If it is, the base is multiplied by the result and the exponent is decremented. Otherwise, the base is squared and the exponent is divided by 2. This is because squaring a number is the same as multiplying it by itself.

At the end of the loop, the result is divided by the base if the original exponent was negative. This is because the inverse of a power is equal to the power with a negative exponent.

Finally, the result is returned.

**Time Complexity:**

The time complexity of this algorithm is O(log n), where n is the exponent. This is because the number of iterations of the loop is proportional to the logarithm of the exponent.

**Space Complexity:**

The space complexity of this algorithm is O(1), which means that the amount of memory used by the algorithm is constant, regardless of the input.

I hope this helps!
