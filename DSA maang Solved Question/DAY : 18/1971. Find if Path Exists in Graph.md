# [1971. Find if Path Exists in Graph]()
There is a **bi-directional graph** with `n` vertices, where each vertex is labeled from `0` to `n - 1` (inclusive). The edges in the graph are represented as a 2D integer array `edges`, where each `edges[i] = [ui, vi]` denotes a bi-directional edge between vertex `ui` and vertex `vi`. Every vertex pair is connected by at most one edge, and no vertex has an edge to itself.

You want to determine if there is a valid path that exists from vertex `source` to vertex `destination`.

Given edges and the integers `n`, `source`, and `destination`, return `true` if there is a valid path from `source` to `destination`, or `false` *otherwise*.

 


**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/08/14/validpath-ex1.png)

> **Input:** n = 3, edges = [[0,1],[1,2],[2,0]], source = 0, destination = 2<br>
**Output:** true<br>
**Explanation:** There are two paths from vertex 0 to vertex 2:
- 0 → 1 → 2
- 0 → 2

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/08/14/validpath-ex2.png)


> **Input:** n = 6, edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[3,5],[5,4],[4,3]], source = 0, destination = 5<br>
**Output:** false<br>
**Explanation:** There is no path from vertex 0 to vertex 5.
 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= n <= 2 * 105`
- `0 <= edges.length <= 2 * 105`
- `edges[i].length == 2`
- `0 <= ui, vi <= n - 1`
- `ui != vi`
- `0 <= source, destination <= n - 1`
- There are no duplicate edges.
- There are no self edges.

# Solution

The approach used in the given code is to use two unordered maps to track the source and destination vertices that are connected to each other in the graph. The first unordered map, `smp`, is used to track the source vertices that are connected to each other. The second unordered map, `dmp`, is used to track the destination vertices that are connected to each other.

The algorithm works as follows:

1. Initialize the `smp` and `dmp` unordered maps.
2. Add the source vertex to `smp` and the destination vertex to `dmp`.
3. Iterate over the edges in the graph.
    * If either of the vertices in the edge is already present in `smp` or `dmp`, then check if the other vertex is the destination vertex. If it is, then return `true`.
    * Add both vertices in the edge to `smp` and `dmp`.
4. Iterate over the edges in the graph again.
    * If either of the vertices in the edge is already present in `smp` or `dmp`, then check if the other vertex is the source vertex. If it is, then return `true`.
    * Add both vertices in the edge to `smp` and `dmp`.
5. Iterate over the source vertices in `smp`.
    * If the destination vertex is present in `smp`, then return `true`.
6. Return `false`.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool validPath(int n, vector<vector<int>>& edges, int source, int destination) {
        unordered_map<int,int> smp;
        unordered_map<int,int> dmp;
        smp[source]++;
        dmp[destination]++;
        for(auto &edge : edges){
            if(smp.count(edge[0]) || smp.count(edge[1])){
                if(edge[0] == destination)
                    return true;
                smp[edge[0]]++;
                smp[edge[1]]++;
            }
        }
        for(auto &edge : edges){
            if(smp.count(edge[0]) || smp.count(edge[1])){
                if(edge[0] == destination)
                    return true;
                smp[edge[0]]++;
                smp[edge[1]]++;
            }
        }
        for(auto &edge : edges){
            if(dmp.count(edge[0]) || dmp.count(edge[1])){
                if(edge[0] == source)
                    return true;
                dmp[edge[0]]++;
                dmp[edge[1]]++;
            }
        }
        for(auto &mp : smp){
            if(dmp.count(mp.first))
                return true;
        }
        return false;
    }
};
```

The time complexity of the algorithm is O(E), where `E` is the number of edges in the graph. This is because the algorithm iterates over the edges in the graph three times. The space complexity of the algorithm is O(V), where `V` is the number of vertices in the graph. This is because the algorithm uses two unordered maps to track the source and destination vertices.

## Pros and Cons of the Given Approach

The following are the pros and cons of the given approach to the `validPath()` problem:

**Pros:**

* Simple to understand and implement.
* Efficient for graphs with a small number of edges.

**Cons:**

* Inefficient for graphs with a large number of edges.
* Requires O(V) space to store the source and destination vertices.

## Conclusion

The given approach to the `validPath()` problem is a simple and straightforward way to solve the problem. However, it is inefficient for graphs with a large number of edges. There are more efficient algorithms for solving this problem, such as using a depth-first search or breadth-first search.
