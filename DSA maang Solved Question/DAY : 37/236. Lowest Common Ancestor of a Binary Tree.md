# [236. Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/lowest-common-ancestor-of-a-binary-tree/)

Given a binary tree, find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the tree.

According to the [definition of LCA on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lowest_common_ancestor): “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes `p` and `q` as the lowest node in `T` that has both `p` and `q` as descendants (where we allow **a node to be a descendant of itself**).”

**Example 1:**

**Input:** root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 1<br>
**Output:** 3<br>
*Explanation:* The LCA of nodes 5 and 1 is 3.

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/14/binarytree.png)

**Input:** root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 4<br>
**Output:** 5<br>
*Explanation:* The LCA of nodes 5 and 4 is 5, since a node can be a descendant of itself according to the LCA definition.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** root = [1,2], p = 1, q = 2<br>
**Output:** 1
 

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[2, 105]`.
- `-1e9 <= Node.val <= 1e9`
- All `Node.val` are unique.
- `p != q`
- `p` and `q` will exist in the tree.

# Solution

The approach used in the given C++ solution to the lowest common ancestor problem is a recursive divide-and-conquer approach.

The algorithm works as follows:

1. If the root node is null, or if the root node is either of the two nodes p or q, then the root node is the lowest common ancestor.
2. Otherwise, recursively find the lowest common ancestor in the left and right subtrees of the root node.
3. If the lowest common ancestor is found in both the left and right subtrees, then the root node is the lowest common ancestor.
4. Otherwise, the lowest common ancestor is the node that is found in either the left or right subtree.

Here is a pseudocode implementation of the algorithm:

```c++
TreeNode* lowestCommonAncestor(TreeNode* root, TreeNode* p, TreeNode* q) {
  // If the root node is null, or if the root node is either of the two nodes p or
  // q, then the root node is the lowest common ancestor.
  if (root == NULL || root == p || root == q) {
    return root;
  }

  // Recursively find the lowest common ancestor in the left and right subtrees of
  // the root node.
  TreeNode* left = lowestCommonAncestor(root->left, p, q);
  TreeNode* right = lowestCommonAncestor(root->right, p, q);

  // If the lowest common ancestor is found in both the left and right subtrees,
  // then the root node is the lowest common ancestor.
  if (left != NULL && right != NULL) {
    return root;
  }

  // Otherwise, the lowest common ancestor is the node that is found in either the
  // left or right subtree.
  return left != NULL ? left : right;
}
```

This algorithm is efficient because it only traverses the tree once. It also uses O(1) space, since it only needs to store the two nodes that are being compared.
