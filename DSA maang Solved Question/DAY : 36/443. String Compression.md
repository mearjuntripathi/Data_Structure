# [443. String Compression](https://leetcode.com/problems/string-compression/)

Given an array of characters `chars`, compress it using the following algorithm:

Begin with an empty string `s`. For each group of consecutive repeating characters in `chars`:

- If the group's length is `1`, append the character to `s`.
- Otherwise, append the character followed by the group's length.

The compressed string `s` **should not be returned separately**, but instead, be stored in the input character array `chars`. Note that group lengths that are `10` or longer will be split into multiple characters in `chars`.

After you are done **modifying the input array**, return the new length of the array.

You must write an algorithm that uses only constant extra space.

 


**Example 1:**

>**Input:** chars = ["a","a","b","b","c","c","c"]<br>
**Output:** Return 6, and the first 6 characters of the input array should be: ["a","2","b","2","c","3"]<br>
**Explanation:** The groups are "aa", "bb", and "ccc". This compresses to "a2b2c3".

**Example 2:**

>**Input:** chars = ["a"]<br>
**Output:** Return 1, and the first character of the input array should be: ["a"]<br>
**Explanation:** The only group is "a", which remains uncompressed since it's a single character.

**Example 3:**

>**Input:** chars = ["a","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b"]<br>
**Output:** Return 4, and the first 4 characters of the input array should be: ["a","b","1","2"].<br>
**Explanation:** The groups are "a" and "bbbbbbbbbbbb". This compresses to "ab12".
 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= chars.length <= 2000`
- `chars[i]` is a lowercase English letter, uppercase English letter, digit, or symbol.

# Solution

The approach of the C++ solution for the `compress()` function is to iterate over the input string and keep track of the current character and its count. If the current character is the same as the previous character, increment the count. Otherwise, add the current character to the output string and append the count to the output string if it is greater than 1.

The algorithm can be summarized as follows:

1. Initialize the output string.
2. Initialize the current character and its count.
3. Iterate over the input string:
    * If the current character is the same as the previous character, increment the count.
    * Otherwise:
        * Add the current character to the output string.
        * If the count is greater than 1, append the count to the output string.
        * Reset the count to 1.
4. Add the last character of the input string to the output string.
5. If the count is greater than 1, append the count to the output string.
6. Return the length of the output string.

Here is the C++ implementation of the `compress()` function:

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int compress(vector<char>& chars) {
        if(chars.size() == 1)
            return 1;
        
        int size = 1;
        int p = 0;
        char current_char = chars[0];
        for(int i = 1 ; i < chars.size() ; i++){
            if(chars[i] == current_char){
                size++;
            }else{
                chars[p++] = current_char;
                if(size > 1){
                    string len = to_string(size);
                    for(auto c : len)
                        chars[p++] = c;
                }
                current_char = chars[i];
                size = 1;
            }
        }
        chars[p++] = current_char;
        if(size > 1){
            string len = to_string(size);
            for(auto c : len)
                chars[p++] = c;
        }
        chars.erase(chars.begin()+p,chars.end());
        return p;
    }
};
```

This implementation is time-efficient and space-efficient. It uses O(n) time and O(1) space to compress the string.
