# [395. Longest Substring with At Least K Repeating Characters](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-with-at-least-k-repeating-characters/)

Given a string `s` and an integer `k`, return the length of the longest substring of s such that the *frequency of each character in this substring is greater than or equal to `k`*.

if no such substring exists, return 0.

**Example 1:**

>**Input:** s = "aaabb", k = 3<br>
**Output:** 3<br>
**Explanation:** The longest substring is "aaa", as 'a' is repeated 3 times.

**Example 2:**

>**Input:** s = "ababbc", k = 2<br>
**Output:** 5<br>
**Explanation:** The longest substring is "ababb", as 'a' is repeated 2 times and 'b' is repeated 3 times.
 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= s.length <= 1e4`
- `s` consists of only lowercase English letters.
- `1 <= k <= 1e5`

# Solution

The approach used in the given C++ solution to the longest substring with k distinct characters problem is a recursive divide-and-conquer approach.

The algorithm works as follows:

1. If the input string is empty or the number of distinct characters required is greater than the length of the string, return 0.
2. If the number of distinct characters required is 1, return the length of the string.
3. Initialize an array of integers, `alfa`, to store the frequency of each character in the string.
4. Iterate over the string and increment the corresponding element in `alfa` for each character.
5. Initialize one pointers, `i` , to the beginning of the string.
6. While `i` is less than the length of the string and the frequency of the character at `i` is greater than or equal to `k`:
    * Increment `i`.
7. If `i` is equal to the length of the string, return the length of the string.
8. Recursively calculate the longest substring with `k` distinct characters in the left and right halves of the string, starting at `0` and `i+1`, respectively.
9. Return the maximum of the longest substring in the left and right halves of the string.

Here is a pseudocode implementation of the algorithm:

```c++
int longestSubstring(string s, int k) {
  // If the input string is empty or the number of distinct characters required is
  // greater than the length of the string, return 0.
  if (s.empty() || k > s.length()) {
    return 0;
  }

  // If the number of distinct characters required is 1, return the length of the
  // string.
  if (k == 1) {
    return s.length();
  }

  // Initialize an array of integers, `alfa`, to store the frequency of each
  // character in the string.
  int alfa[26] = {0};
  for (char c : s) {
    alfa[c - 'a']++;
  }

  // Initialize two pointers, `i`, to the beginning of the string.
  int i = 0;

  // While `i` is less than the length of the string and the frequency of the
  // character at `i` is greater than or equal to `k`:
  while (i < s.length() && alfa[s[i] - 'a'] >= k) {
    i++;
  }

  // If `i` is equal to the length of the string, return the length of the
  // string.
  if (i == s.length()) {
    return s.length();
  }

  // Recursively calculate the longest substring with `k` distinct characters in
  // the left and right halves of the string, starting at `0` and `i+1`,
  // respectively.
  int left = longestSubstring(s.substr(0, i), k);
  int right = longestSubstring(s.substr(i + 1), k);

  // Return the maximum of the longest substring in the left and right halves of
  // the string.
  return max(left, right);
}
```

This C++ implementation of the longest substring with k distinct characters algorithm is time-efficient and space-efficient. It uses O(n) time to calculate the frequency of each character in the string and O(log n) time to recursively calculate the longest substring with `k` distinct characters in the left and right halves of the string. The space complexity of the algorithm is O(1).
