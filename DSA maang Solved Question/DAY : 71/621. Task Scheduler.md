# [621. Task Scheduler](https://leetcode.com/problems/task-scheduler/)

Given a characters array `tasks`, representing the tasks a CPU needs to do, where each letter represents a different task. Tasks could be done in any order. Each task is done in one unit of time. For each unit of time, the CPU could complete either one task or just be idle.

However, there is a non-negative integer `n` that represents the cooldown period between two same tasks (the same letter in the array), that is that there must be at least `n` units of time between any two same tasks.

Return the least number of units of times that the CPU will take to finish all the given tasks.

**Example 1:**

>**Input:** tasks = ["A","A","A","B","B","B"], n = 2<br>
**Output:** 8<br>
**Explanation:** <br>
A -> B -> idle -> A -> B -> idle -> A -> B
There is at least 2 units of time between any two same tasks.

**Example 2:**

>**Input:** tasks = ["A","A","A","B","B","B"], n = 0<br>
**Output:** 6<br>
**Explanation:** On this case any permutation of size 6 would work since n = 0.<br>
["A","A","A","B","B","B"]<br>
["A","B","A","B","A","B"]<br>
["B","B","B","A","A","A"]<br>
...<br>
And so on.

**Example 3:**

>**Input:** tasks = ["A","A","A","A","A","A","B","C","D","E","F","G"], n = 2<br>
**Output:** 16<br>
**Explanation:** <br>
One possible solution is<br>
A -> B -> C -> A -> D -> E -> A -> F -> G -> A -> idle -> idle -> A -> idle -> idle -> A
 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= task.length <= 1e4`
- `tasks[i]` is upper-case English letter.
- The integer n is in the range `[0, 100]`.

# Solution
Here is an approach and algorithm for the given solution in C++:

**Approach**

The approach is to first determine the frequency of each character in the input vector. Then, identify the character with the maximum frequency (max) and the number of characters with that frequency (maxCount). Finally, calculate the number of empty slots and idle times using the following formulas:

* emptySlots = partCount * partLength
* idles = (emptySlots - avilableTasks) > 0 ? (emptySlots - avilableTasks) : 0

where partCount = max - 1 and partLength = n - (maxCount - 1), and avilableTasks = tasks.size() - max * maxCount.

**Algorithm**

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int leastInterval(vector<char>& tasks, int n) {
        int alfa[26] = {0};

        int max = 0;
        int maxCount = 0;
        for(auto task : tasks){
            alfa[task - 'A']++;

            if(max == alfa[task - 'A'])
                maxCount++;
            else if(max < alfa[task - 'A']){
                max = alfa[task - 'A'];
                maxCount = 1;
            }
        }

        int partCount = max - 1;
        int partLength = n - (maxCount - 1);
        int emptySlots = partCount * partLength;
        int avilableTasks = tasks.size() - max * maxCount;
        int idles = (emptySlots - avilableTasks) > 0 ? (emptySlots - avilableTasks) : 0;

        return tasks.size() + idles;
    }
};
```
