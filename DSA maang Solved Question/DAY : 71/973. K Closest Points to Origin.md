# [973. K Closest Points to Origin](https://leetcode.com/problems/k-closest-points-to-origin/)

Given an array of points where `points[i] = [xi, yi]` represents a point on the X-Y plane and an integer k, return the k closest points to the origin `(0, 0)`.

The distance between two points on the X-Y plane is the Euclidean distance (i.e., `âˆš((x1 - x2)^2 + (y1 - y2)^2)` ).

You may return the answer in any order. The answer is guaranteed to be unique (except for the order that it is in).


**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/03/03/closestplane1.jpg)

>**Input:** points = [[1,3],[-2,2]], k = 1<br>
**Output:** [[-2,2]]<br>
**Explanation:**<br>
The distance between (1, 3) and the origin is sqrt(10).<br>
The distance between (-2, 2) and the origin is sqrt(8).<br>
Since sqrt(8) < sqrt(10), (-2, 2) is closer to the origin.<br>
We only want the closest k = 1 points from the origin, so the answer is just [[-2,2]].

**Example 2:**

>**Input:** points = [[3,3],[5,-1],[-2,4]], k = 2<br>
**Output:** [[3,3],[-2,4]]<br>
**Explanation:** The answer [[-2,4],[3,3]] would also be accepted.
 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= k <= points.length <= 1e4`
- `-1e4 <= xi, yi <= 1e4`

# Solution

Sure, here is an approach and algorithm for the provided solution in C++:

**Approach:**

The approach for this solution is to first calculate the distance from each point to the origin. Then, sort the distances in ascending order. Finally, select the k points with the smallest distances as the result.

**Algorithm:**

```c++
class Solution {
    int calculateDistance(vector<int> &point) {
        return point[0] * point[0] + point[1] * point[1];
    }

public:
    vector<vector<int>> kClosest(vector<vector<int>>& points, int k) {
        vector<vector<int>> result;
        vector<int> distances;

        // Calculate the distance for each point
        for (auto& point : points) {
            int distance = calculateDistance(point);
            distances.push_back(distance);
        }

        // Sort the distances in ascending order
        sort(distances.begin(), distances.end());

        // Select the k points with the smallest distances
        int kthDistance = distances[k - 1];
        for (int i = 0; i < points.size(); i++) {
            if (distances[i] <= kthDistance) {
                result.push_back(points[i]);
            }
        }

        return result;
    }
};
```

**Time Complexity:**

The time complexity of the algorithm is O(n log n), where n is the number of points. This is because sorting the distances takes O(n log n) time.

**Space Complexity:**

The space complexity of the algorithm is O(n), where n is the number of points. This is because the algorithm needs to store the distances for all of the points.

I hope this helps!
