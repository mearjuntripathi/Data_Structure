# [658. Find K Closest Elements](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-k-closest-elements/)

Given a sorted integer array `arr`, two integers `k` and `x`, return the `k` closest integers to `x` in the array. The result should also be sorted in ascending order.

An integer `a` is closer to `x` than an integer `b` if:

- `|a - x| < |b - x|`, or
- `|a - x| == |b - x|` and `a < b`

**Example 1:**

**Input:** arr = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 4, x = 3<br>
**Output:** [1,2,3,4]

**Example 2:**

**Input:** arr = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 4, x = -1<br>
**Output:** [1,2,3,4]
 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= k <= arr.length`
- `1 <= arr.length <= 1e4`
- `arr` is sorted in ascending order.
- `-1e4 <= arr[i], x <= 1e4`

# Solution
Sure, here is an approach and algorithm for this solution in C++:

**Approach:**

1. Use binary search to find the index of the element in the sorted array that is closest to the target value.

2. Once the index is found, check the elements on both sides of the index to find the `k` elements that are closest to the target value.

**Algorithm:**

```c++
int binarySearch(vector<int> &arr, int num){
    int s = 0;
    int e = arr.size()-1;
    int ans = e;
    while(s <= e){
        int mid = s + (e-s)/2;

        if(arr[mid] >= num){
            ans = mid;
            e = mid - 1;
        }
        else if(arr[mid] < num){
            s = mid + 1;
        }else{
            e = mid - 1;
        }
    }
    return ans;
}

public:
    vector<int> findClosestElements(vector<int>& arr, int k, int x) {
        int high = binarySearch(arr,x);
        int low = high-1;
        while(k--){
            if(low < 0)
                high++;
            else if((high >= arr.size()) || (x - arr[low] <= arr[high]-x))
                low--;
            else high++;
        }
        return vector<int>(arr.begin()+ low + 1, arr.begin() + high);
    }
};
```

**Explanation:**

The function `binarySearch()` takes an array `arr` and a target value `num` as input. It returns the index of the element in `arr` that is closest to `num`. The function works by recursively dividing the search space in half until the target value is found.

The function `findClosestElements()` takes an array `arr`, an integer `k`, and an integer `x` as input. It returns a vector containing the `k` elements in `arr` that are closest to `x`. The function works by first calling `binarySearch()` to find the index of the element in `arr` that is closest to `x`. Then, it checks the elements on both sides of the index to find the `k` elements that are closest to `x`.

I hope this helps!
