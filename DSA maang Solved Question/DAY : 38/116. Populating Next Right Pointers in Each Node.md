# [116. Populating Next Right Pointers in Each Node](https://leetcode.com/problems/populating-next-right-pointers-in-each-node/)

You are given a **perfect binary tree** where all leaves are on the same level, and every parent has two children. The binary tree has the following definition:
><pre>
>struct Node {
>  int val;
>  Node *left;
>  Node *right;
>  Node *next;
>}
></pre>
Populate each next pointer to point to its next right node. If there is no next right node, the next pointer should be set to `NULL`.

Initially, all next pointers are set to `NULL`.


**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/02/14/116_sample.png)

**Input:** root = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]<br>
**Output:** [1,#,2,3,#,4,5,6,7,#]<br>
**Explanation:** Given the above perfect binary tree (Figure A), your function should populate each next pointer to point to its next right node, just like in Figure B. The serialized output is in level order as connected by the next pointers, with '#' signifying the end of each level.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** root = []<br>
**Output:** []<br>
 

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 212 - 1]`.
- `-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000`
 

**Follow-up:**

- You may only use constant extra space.
- The recursive approach is fine. You may assume implicit stack space does not count as extra space for this problem.

# Solution
This solution to the Connect Nodes at Same Level problem uses two approaches:

**Approach 1:**

This approach uses a recursive approach.

1. If the root node is `null`, return `null`.
2. Call the `connect()` function on the left and right subtrees of the root node, passing in the root node as the next pointer for each node in the subtree.
3. Return the root node.

**Algorithm:**

```c++
Node* connect(Node* root) {
  if (!root) {
    return root;
  }

  if (root->left) {
    root->left->next = root->right;
  }

  if (root->right && root->next) {
    root->right->next = root->next->left;
  }

  connect(root->left);
  connect(root->right);

  return root;
}
```

**Approach 2:**

This approach uses an iterative approach.

1. Initialize two pointers, `prev` and `curr`, to the root node.
2. While `prev` is not `null`:
    * Set `curr` to `prev`.
    * While `curr` is not `null` and `curr->left` is not `null`:
        * Set `curr->left->next` to `curr->right`.
        * If `curr->next` is not `null`, set `curr->right->next` to `curr->next->left`.
        * Set `curr` to `curr->next`.
    * Set `prev` to `prev->left`.
3. Return the root node.

**Algorithm:**

```c++
Node* connect(Node* root) {
  Node* prev = root, *curr;
  while (prev) {
    curr = prev;
    while (curr && curr->left) {
      curr->left->next = curr->right;

      if (curr->next) {
        curr->right->next = curr->next->left;
      }

      curr = curr->next;
    }
    prev = prev->left;
  }
  return root;
}
```
Both of these approaches are correct and have the same time complexity of `O(n)`, where `n` is the number of nodes in the tree. The recursive approach is more concise, but the iterative approach is more efficient in terms of space complexity.

Which approach to use depends on the specific requirements of the problem. If the problem requires a recursive solution, then Approach 1 should be used. If the problem requires an iterative solution, then Approach 2 should be used.
