# [662. Maximum Width of Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-width-of-binary-tree/)

Given the `root` of a binary tree, return the **maximum width** of the given tree.

The **maximum width** of a tree is the maximum **width** among all levels.

The width of one level is defined as the length between the end-nodes (the leftmost and rightmost non-null nodes), where the null nodes between the end-nodes that would be present in a complete binary tree extending down to that level are also counted into the length calculation.

It is **guaranteed** that the answer will in the range of a 32-bit signed integer.

 


**Example 1:**

**Input:** root = [1,3,2,5,3,null,9]<br>
**Output:** 4<br>
**Explanation:** The maximum width exists in the third level with length 4 (5,3,null,9).

**Example 2:**

https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/05/03/width1-tree.jpg
**Input:** root = [1,3,2,5,null,null,9,6,null,7]<br>
**Output:** 7<br>
**Explanation:** The maximum width exists in the fourth level with length 7 (6,null,null,null,null,null,7).

**Example 3:**


**Input:** root = [1,3,2,5]<br>
**Output:** 2<br>
**Explanation:** The maximum width exists in the second level with length 2 (3,2).
 

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 3000]`.
- `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`

# Solution

The approach used in the given C++ solution is to use a queue to perform a level-order traversal of the tree. At each level, the queue will contain all the nodes at that level, along with their corresponding indices. The index of a node is calculated by multiplying the index of its parent node by 2 and adding 1 if it is the left child and 2 if it is the right child.

The algorithm works as follows:

1. Initialize a queue and add the root node to it with an index of 0.
2. Initialize the maximum width variable to 0.
3. While the queue is not empty:
    * Get the length of the queue.
    * Get the start and last indices of the nodes at the current level.
    * Calculate the width of the current level by subtracting the start index from the last index and adding 1.
    * Update the maximum width variable if the width of the current level is greater than the maximum width.
    * For each node in the current level:
        * If the node has a left child, add it to the queue with an index of 2 * node->index + 1.
        * If the node has a right child, add it to the queue with an index of 2 * node->index + 2.

4. Return the maximum width variable.

The following is a detailed explanation of the algorithm:

```c++
int Solution::widthOfBinaryTree(TreeNode* root) {
    int maxWidth = 0;
    if(!root) return maxWidth;

    queue<pair<TreeNode*, int>> que; // Queue to store the nodes at each level.
    int start, last; // Start and last indices of the nodes at the current level.
    int length; // Length of the queue at the current level.
    long long idx; // Index of the current node.

    que.push({root,0}); // Add the root node to the queue with an index of 0.

    while(!que.empty()) {
        length = que.size();
        mi = que.front().second;
        for(int i = 0 ; i < length ; i++) {
            TreeNode *dummy = que.front().first;
            idx = que.front().second - mi;
            que.pop();

            if(i == 0) start = idx;
            if(i == length-1) last = idx;

            if(dummy->left) que.push({dummy->left, idx*2 + 1});
            if(dummy->right) que.push({dummy->right, idx*2 + 2});
        }

        maxWidth = max(maxWidth, (last-start)+1); // Update the maximum width variable.
    }

    return maxWidth;
}
```

This algorithm is efficient and uses O(n) space, where n is the number of nodes in the tree.
