# [117. Populating Next Right Pointers in Each Node II](https://leetcode.com/problems/populating-next-right-pointers-in-each-node-ii/)

Given a binary tree

><pre>struct Node {
>  int val;
>  Node *left;
>  Node *right;
>  Node *next;
>}</pre>
Populate each next pointer to point to its next right node. If there is no next right node, the next pointer should be set to `NULL`.

Initially, all next pointers are set to `NULL`.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/02/15/117_sample.png)

>**Input:** root = [1,2,3,4,5,null,7]<br>
**Output:** [1,#,2,3,#,4,5,7,#]<br>
**Explanation:** Given the above binary tree (Figure A), your function should populate each next pointer to point to its next right node, just like in Figure B. The serialized output is in level order as connected by the next pointers, with '#' signifying the end of each level.

**Example 2:**

>**Input:** root = []<br>
**Output:** []
 

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 6000]`.
- `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`
 

**Follow-up:**

- You may only use constant extra space.
- The recursive approach is fine. You may assume implicit stack space does not count as extra space for this problem.

# Solution
This solution to the problem of connecting next right pointers in a binary tree uses two approaches:

**Approach 1:**

This approach uses recursive DFS and is simple to implement. The idea is to recursively traverse the tree in preorder fashion and connect the left and right children of each node to their next right siblings, if they exist.

**Algorithm:**

```cpp
Node* connect(Node* root) {
    if(!root) return root;

    if(root->left){
        if(root->right)
            root->left->next = root->right;
        else
            root->left->next = nextRight(root->next);
    }
    if(root->right && root->next){
        if(root->next->left) 
            root->right->next = root->next->left;
        else
            root->right->next = nextRight(root->next);
    }
    connect(root->right);
    connect(root->left);
    return root;
}

Node* nextRight(Node *root){
    if(!root) return NULL;
    if(root->left)  return root->left;
    if(root->right) return root->right;
    return nextRight(root->next);
}
```

**Approach 2:**

This approach uses iterative BFS and is more space-efficient than Approach 1. The idea is to use a queue to store the nodes of the tree in level-order fashion. For each level of the tree, we connect the left and right children of each node to their next right siblings, if they exist.

**Algorithm:**

```cpp
Node* connect(Node *root){
    if(!root) return NULL;

    Node *prev = NULL;
    Node *head = NULL;
    Node *curr = root;

    while(curr){
        while(curr){
            if(curr->left){
                if(prev)  prev->next = curr->left;
                else head = curr->left;
                prev = curr->left;
            }
            if(curr->right){
                if(prev) prev->next = curr->right;
                else head = curr->right;
                prev = curr->right;
            }
            curr = curr->next;
        }
        curr = head;
        head = NULL;
        prev = NULL;
    }
    return root;
}
```

Which approach to use depends on the specific requirements of the problem. If time is a constraint, then Approach 1 is a good choice. However, if space is a constraint, then Approach 2 is a better choice.
