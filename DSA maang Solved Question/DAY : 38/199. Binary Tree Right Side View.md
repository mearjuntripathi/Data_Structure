# [199. Binary Tree Right Side View](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-right-side-view/)

Given the `root` of a binary tree, imagine yourself standing on the right side of it, return the values of the nodes you can see ordered from top to bottom.

**Example 1:**

>**Input:** root = [1,2,3,null,5,null,4]<br>
**Output:** [1,3,4]

**Example 2:**

>**Input:** root = [1,null,3]<br>
**Output:** [1,3]

**Example 3:**

>**Input:** root = []<br>
**Output:** []
 

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 100]`.
- `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`

# Solution

**Approach 1: Depth First Search:**

1. Recursively traverse the tree in preorder.
2. At each node, add the node's value to the result vector if the node is the rightmost node in its level.

**Algorithm:**

```c++
void rightSideView(TreeNode* root, vector<int> &view, int i){
    if(!root) return;
    if(i == view.size())
        view.push_back(root->val);
        
    rightSideView(root->right, view, i+1);
    rightSideView(root->left, view, i+1);
}

vector<int> rightSideView(TreeNode* root) {
    vector<int> view;
    rightSideView(root, view, 0);
    return view;
}
```

**Approach 2: Breadth First Search:**

1. Maintain a queue of nodes.
2. At each step, add the value of the rightmost node in the queue to the result vector.
3. Remove all the nodes from the queue and add their children to the queue.

**Algorithm:**

```c++
vector<int> rightSideView(TreeNode* root) {
    // using queue Breath First Search
    if(!root) return{};

    queue<TreeNode*> que;
    que.push(root);
    vector<int> view;

    while(!que.empty()){
        int length = que.size();

        while(length--){
            TreeNode *dummy = que.front();
            que.pop();

            if(length == 0) view.push_back(dummy->val);

            if(dummy->left) que.push(dummy->left);

            if(dummy->right) que.push(dummy->right);
        }
    }
    return view;
}
```

**Complexity Analysis:**

Both approaches have the same time and space complexity.

* **Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree.
* **Space Complexity:** O(h), where h is the height of the tree.

Which approach to use depends on the specific requirements of the problem. If the tree is balanced, then both approaches will have the same time and space complexity. However, if the tree is unbalanced, then the breadth-first search approach will have better time complexity.
