# [1353. Maximum Number of Events That Can Be Attended](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-number-of-events-that-can-be-attended/)

You are given an array of events where `events[i] = [startDayi, endDayi]`. Every event `i` starts at `startDayi` and ends at `endDayi`.

You can attend an event `i` at any day `d` where `startTimei <= d <= endTimei`. You can only attend one event at any time `d`.

Return the maximum number of events you can attend.

**Example 1:**

>**Input:** events = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4]]<br>
**Output:** 3<br>
**Explanation:** You can attend all the three events.<br>
One way to attend them all is as shown.<br>
Attend the first event on day 1.<br>
Attend the second event on day 2.<br>
Attend the third event on day 3.

**Example 2:**

>**Input:** events= [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[1,2]]<br>
**Output:** 4

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= events.length <= 1e5`
- `events[i].length == 2`
- `1 <= startDayi <= endDayi <= 1e5`

# Solution
Sure, here is a summary of the algorithm and approach of the provided code in C++:

**Algorithm**

The algorithm involves sorting the events by their start times and maintaining a priority queue of the end times of the currently scheduled events. At each time step, the algorithm removes the earliest ending event from the priority queue and schedules a new event if one is available. If the priority queue becomes empty, it means that no events can be scheduled at that time, and the algorithm moves on to the next time step.

**Approach**

The approach is to schedule as many events as possible without overlapping. The priority queue is used to keep track of the events that are currently scheduled and to ensure that the events with the earliest end times are removed first. This ensures that the algorithm always schedules the event that is most likely to end first, which maximizes the number of events that can be scheduled.

**Code Breakdown**

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int maxEvents(vector<vector<int>>& events) {
        sort(events.begin(), events.end());
        priority_queue<int, vector<int>, greater<int>> pq;
        int i=0, n=events.size(), res=0;
        for (int d=1; d<=100000; ++d) {
            while (!pq.empty() && pq.top()<d) pq.pop();
            while (i<n && events[i][0]==d) pq.push(events[i++][1]);
            if (!pq.empty()) {
                pq.pop();
                ++res;
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```

1. The `maxEvents()` function takes a vector of vectors of integers as input, where each inner vector represents an event with a start time and an end time.

2. The `sort()` function is used to sort the events by their start times.

3. The `priority_queue` is used to store the end times of the currently scheduled events. The `greater<>` comparator ensures that the events with the earliest end times are removed first.

4. The variables `i`, `n`, and `res` are used to keep track of the current index in the `events` vector, the number of events, and the number of events that have been scheduled so far.

5. The `for` loop iterates over each day from 1 to 100,000 (the maximum possible value for an event's start or end time).

6. Inside the `for` loop, the `while (!pq.empty() && pq.top()<d)` loop removes events from the priority queue until the earliest ending event is at least as late as the current day.

7. The `while (i<n && events[i][0]==d)` loop adds events to the priority queue until the current event's start time is later than the current day.

8. If the priority queue is not empty, it means that there is an event that can be scheduled at the current day. The `pq.pop()` function removes the earliest ending event from the priority queue, and the `++res;` statement increments the count of scheduled events.

9. The `return res;` statement returns the total number of events that were scheduled.

This algorithm efficiently schedules as many events as possible without overlapping, maximizing the total number of events that can be attended.
