# [451. Sort Characters By Frequency](https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-characters-by-frequency/)

Given a string `s`, sort it in decreasing order based on the frequency of the characters. The frequency of a character is the number of times it appears in the string.

Return the sorted string. If there are multiple answers, return any of them.

**Example 1:**

>**Input:** s = "tree"<br>
**Output:** "eert"<br>
**Explanation:** 'e' appears twice while 'r' and 't' both appear once.<br>
So 'e' must appear before both 'r' and 't'. Therefore "eetr" is also a valid answer.

**Example 2:**

>**Input:** s = "cccaaa"<br>
**Output:** "aaaccc"<br>
**Explanation:** Both 'c' and 'a' appear three times, so both "cccaaa" and<br> "aaaccc" are valid answers.
Note that "cacaca" is incorrect, as the same characters must be together.

**Example 3:**

>**Input:** s = "Aabb"<br>
**Output:** "bbAa"<br>
**Explanation:** "bbaA" is also a valid answer, but "Aabb" is incorrect.<br>
Note that 'A' and 'a' are treated as two different characters.
 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= s.length <= 5 * 1e5`
- `s` consists of uppercase and lowercase English letters and digits.

# Solution

Sure, here is an algorithm and approach for the provided code in C++:

**Algorithm:**

1. Create an unordered map to store the frequency of each character in the input string.
2. Create a priority queue to store the characters and their corresponding frequencies. The priority queue should be ordered by frequency, with the characters with the highest frequencies at the top of the queue.
3. Iterate over the unordered map and add each character and its frequency to the priority queue.
4. While the priority queue is not empty, remove the character with the highest frequency from the queue and append it to the result string. Repeat this step until the priority queue is empty.
5. Return the result string.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    string frequencySort(string &s) {
        unordered_map<char,int> mp;

        for(auto ch : s)
            mp[ch]++;
        
        priority_queue<pair<int,char>> pq;

        for(auto it : mp)
            pq.push({it.second, it.first});
        
        string res = "";

        while(!pq.empty()){
            int i = pq.top().first;
            while(i--)
                res += pq.top().second;
            pq.pop();
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```

**Approach:**

The provided code uses a priority queue to store the characters and their corresponding frequencies. This allows us to efficiently find the character with the highest frequency at each step of the algorithm. By appending this character to the result string and removing it from the priority queue, we can effectively sort the characters by their frequencies.

**Complexity Analysis:**

The time complexity of the algorithm is O(n log n), where n is the length of the input string. This is because the unordered map lookup and insertion operations take O(1) time, and the priority queue push and pop operations take O(log n) time. The space complexity of the algorithm is also O(n), because we need to store the input string, the frequency map, and the priority queue.

I hope this helps!
