# [166. Fraction to Recurring Decimal](https://leetcode.com/problems/fraction-to-recurring-decimal/)

Given two integers representing the `numerator` and `denominator` of a fraction, return the fraction in string format.

If the fractional part is repeating, enclose the repeating part in parentheses.

If multiple answers are possible, return any of them.

It is guaranteed that the length of the answer string is less than `1e4` for all the given inputs.

**Example 1:**

>**Input:** numerator = 1, denominator = 2<br>
**Output:** "0.5"

**Example 2:**

>**Input:** numerator = 2, denominator = 1<br>
**Output:** "2"

**Example 3:**

>**Input:** numerator = 4, denominator = 333<br>
**Output:** "0.(012)"
 

**Constraints:**

- `-2^31 <= numerator, denominator <= 2^31 - 1`
- `denominator != 0`

# Solution

Here is an approach and algorithm for the `fractionToDecimal` function in C++:

**Approach:**

1. Check if the numerator is 0. If it is, return the string "0".
2. Create an unordered map to store the remainders and their positions in the fraction string.
3. Initialize a string to store the fraction, a boolean variable to indicate whether the decimal point has been reached, and an integer variable to store the index of the repeating sequence, if any.
4. Set the sign of the fraction based on the signs of the numerator and denominator.
5. Take the absolute values of the numerator and denominator.
6. If the denominator is 1, return the string representation of the numerator, with the appropriate sign.
7. While the numerator is not 0:
    * If the remainder is already in the unordered map, then the fraction has a repeating sequence. Set the index of the repeating sequence to the position of the remainder in the map.
    * While the numerator is less than the denominator, multiply the numerator by 10 and append a 0 to the fraction string. If the decimal point has not been reached, append a decimal point to the fraction string.
    * Store the remainder in the unordered map.
    * Divide the numerator by the denominator and append the quotient to the fraction string.
    * Subtract the quotient times the denominator from the numerator.
8. If the numerator is 0, then the fraction is terminating. Return the fraction string, with the appropriate sign.
9. Otherwise, the fraction is repeating. Return the fraction string up to the index of the repeating sequence, followed by a parenthesis, followed by the repeating sequence, followed by a closing parenthesis.

**Algorithm:**

```c++
string Solution::fractionToDecimal(long long numerator, long long denominator) {
    if(numerator == 0)
        return "0";
    unordered_map<int,int> mp;

    bool decimal = false;
    string fraction = "";
    int idx = 0;
    bool sign = true;

    if(numerator < 0 && denominator < 0)
        sign = true;
    else if(numerator < 0 || denominator < 0)
        sign = false;
    
    numerator = abs(numerator);
    denominator = abs(denominator);

    if(denominator == 1) return (sign ? "" : "-") + to_string(numerator);
    
    while(numerator){
        if(mp.find(numerator) != mp.end()){
            idx = mp[numerator];
            break;
        }
        int cnt = 0;
        while(numerator < denominator){
            if(fraction == ""){
                fraction += "0.";
                decimal = true;
            }
            if(cnt) fraction += '0';
            if(!decimal){
                fraction += '.';
                decimal = true;
            }
            mp[numerator] = fraction.size();
            numerator *= 10;
            cnt++;
        }
        int v = numerator/denominator;
        long long big = denominator * v;
        fraction += to_string(v);
        numerator -= big;
    }
    if(numerator == 0)
        return (sign ? "" : "-") + fraction;
    return (sign ? "" : "-") + fraction.substr(0, idx) +'('+ fraction.substr(idx) + ')';
}
```

This algorithm works by repeatedly dividing the numerator by the denominator and appending the quotient to the fraction string. If the numerator is less than the denominator, a 0 is appended to the fraction string before the decimal point. The remainder of each division is stored in an unordered map. If the remainder is already in the map, then the fraction has a repeating sequence. The index of the repeating sequence is set to the position of the remainder in the map. Once the fraction has been converted to a string, the appropriate sign is added and the string is returned.
