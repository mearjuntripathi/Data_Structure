# [535. Encode and Decode TinyURL](https://leetcode.com/problems/encode-and-decode-tinyurl/)

> Note: This is a companion problem to the [System Design](https://leetcode.com/discuss/interview-question/system-design/) problem: [Design TinyURL](https://leetcode.com/discuss/interview-question/124658/Design-a-URL-Shortener-(-TinyURL-)-System/).

TinyURL is a URL shortening service where you enter a URL such as `https://leetcode.com/problems/design-tinyurl` and it returns a short URL such as `http://tinyurl.com/4e9iAk`. Design a class to encode a URL and decode a tiny URL.

There is no restriction on how your encode/decode algorithm should work. You just need to ensure that a URL can be encoded to a tiny URL and the tiny URL can be decoded to the original URL.

Implement the Solution class:

- `Solution()` Initializes the object of the system.
- `String encode(String longUrl)` Returns a tiny URL for the given `longUrl`.
- `String decode(String shortUrl)` Returns the original long URL for the given `shortUrl`. It is guaranteed that the given `shortUrl` was encoded by the same object.

**Example 1:**

> **Input:** url = "https://leetcode.com/problems/design-tinyurl"<br>
**Output:** "https://leetcode.com/problems/design-tinyurl"<br>
**Explanation:**<br>
Solution obj = new Solution();<br>
string tiny = obj.encode(url); // returns the encoded tiny url.<br>
string ans = obj.decode(tiny); // returns the original url after decoding it.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= url.length <= 104`
- `url` is guranteed to be a valid URL.

# Solution

The approach for this solution is to use a hash table to store the mappings between shortened URLs and their original URLs. The algorithm is as follows:

1. **Encode:**
    * Create a new shortened URL using a counter.
    * Add the shortened URL to the hash table with the original URL as its value.
    * Return the shortened URL.
2. **Decode:**
    * Look up the shortened URL in the hash table.
    * Return the original URL associated with the shortened URL, or an empty string if the shortened URL is not found in the hash table.

The following is a C++ implementation of the above algorithm:

```c++
class Solution {
    unordered_map<string, string> url;
    int urls = 0;
public:
    // Encodes a URL to a shortened URL.
    string encode(string longUrl) {
        string tinyUrl = "https://"+to_string(urls++);
        url[tinyUrl] = longUrl;
        return tinyUrl;
    }

    // Decodes a shortened URL to its original URL.
    string decode(string shortUrl) {
        return url[shortUrl];
    }
};
```

To use the above solution, you would first instantiate a `Solution` object. Then, you could call the `encode()` method to shorten a URL, and the `decode()` method to decode a shortened URL. For example:

```c++
Solution solution;
string shortUrl = solution.encode("https://www.example.com");
string longUrl = solution.decode(shortUrl);
```

The `longUrl` variable would now contain the original URL, "https://www.example.com".
