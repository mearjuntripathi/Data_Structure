>**Input:** root = [1,2,3,4,null,5,6,null,null,7]<br>
**Output:** 7
 

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 104]`.
- `-2^31 <= Node.val <= 2^31 - 1`

# Solution
This C++ solution to the Find Bottom Left Value of a Binary Tree problem uses a recursive approach to traverse the tree and keep track of the deepest leftmost node.

**Algorithm:**

The algorithm works as follows:

1. Initialize two variables, `bottom` and `bh`. `bottom` will store the value of the deepest leftmost node, and `bh` will store the height of the deepest leftmost node.
2. Recursively traverse the tree, starting at the root node.
    * If the current node is a leaf node and `bh` is less than the current height, then update `bottom` to the value of the current node and `bh` to the current height.
    * Recursively traverse the left subtree of the current node.
    * Recursively traverse the right subtree of the current node.
3. Return the value of `bottom`.

**Implementation:**

The following C++ code implements the above algorithm:

```c++
class Solution {
private:
    int bottom;
    int bh = 0;
    void findBottomLeftValue(TreeNode* root, int height){
        if(!root) return;
        if(!root->left && !root->right && bh < height){
            bottom = root->val;
            bh = height;
        }
        findBottomLeftValue(root->left,height+1);
        findBottomLeftValue(root->right,height+1);
        root->left = NULL;
        root->right = NULL;
    }
public:
    int findBottomLeftValue(TreeNode* root) {
        bottom = root->val;
        findBottomLeftValue(root,0);
        return bottom;
    }
};
```

This solution is time-efficient and space-efficient. It uses O(h) time to traverse the tree, where h is the height of the tree. It also uses O(1) space to store the value of the deepest leftmost node and its height.
