# [222. Count Complete Tree Nodes](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-complete-tree-nodes/)

Given the `root` of a complete binary tree, return the number of the nodes in the tree.

According to [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_tree#Types_of_binary_trees), every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled in a complete binary tree, and all nodes in the last level are as far left as possible. It can have between `1` and `2^h` nodes inclusive at the last level `h`.

Design an algorithm that runs in less than `O(n)` time complexity.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/01/14/complete.jpg)

>**Input:** root = [1,2,3,4,5,6]<br>
**Output:** 6

**Example 2:**

>**Input:** root = []<br>
**Output:** 0

**Example 3:**

>**Input:** root = [1]<br>
**Output:** 1
 

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 5 * 1e4]`.
- `0 <= Node.val <= 5 * 1e4`
- The tree is guaranteed to be **complete**.

# Solution

**Approach:**

This solution to the Count Nodes in Binary Tree problem uses a post-order traversal of the tree. It recursively counts the number of nodes in the left and right subtrees of each node, and then adds 1 to count the node itself.

**Algorithm:**

```c++
int countNodes(TreeNode* root) {
  if (!root) return 0;
  return countNodes(root->left) + countNodes(root->right) + 1;
}
```

**Explanation:**

The `countNodes()` function takes a pointer to the root node of the tree as its argument. If the root node is `NULL`, then the function returns 0, indicating that there are no nodes in the tree. Otherwise, the function recursively counts the number of nodes in the left and right subtrees of the root node, and then adds 1 to count the root node itself.

The following is a step-by-step explanation of the `countNodes()` algorithm:

1. If the root node is `NULL`, then return 0.
2. Recursively count the number of nodes in the left subtree of the root node.
3. Recursively count the number of nodes in the right subtree of the root node.
4. Add 1 to count the root node itself.
5. Return the total number of nodes in the tree.

**Example:**

Consider the following binary tree:

```
    1
   / \
  2   3
 / \
4   5
```

To count the number of nodes in this tree, we would call the `countNodes()` function on the root node:

```c++
int count = countNodes(root);
```

The `countNodes()` function would then recursively count the number of nodes in the left and right subtrees of the root node:

```c++
count = countNodes(root->left) + countNodes(root->right) + 1;
```

The `countNodes()` function would then return the total number of nodes in the tree, which is 5:

```c++
return count;
```
