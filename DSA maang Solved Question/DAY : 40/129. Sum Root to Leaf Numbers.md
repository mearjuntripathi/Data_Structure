# [129. Sum Root to Leaf Numbers](https://leetcode.com/problems/sum-root-to-leaf-numbers/)

You are given the `root` of a binary tree containing digits from `0` to `9` only.

Each root-to-leaf path in the tree represents a number.

- For example, the root-to-leaf path `1 -> 2 -> 3` represents the number `123`.

Return the total sum of all root-to-leaf numbers. Test cases are generated so that the answer will fit in a `32-bit` integer.

A **leaf** node is a node with no children.

**Example 1:**

>**Input:** root = [1,2,3]<br>
**Output:** 25<br>
**Explanation:**<br>
The root-to-leaf path 1->2 represents the number 12.<br>
The root-to-leaf path 1->3 represents the number 13.<br>
Therefore, sum = 12 + 13 = 25.

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/02/19/num2tree.jpg)

>**Input:** root = [4,9,0,5,1]<br>
**Output:** 1026<br>
**Explanation:**<br>
The root-to-leaf path 4->9->5 represents the number 495.<br>
The root-to-leaf path 4->9->1 represents the number 491.<br>
The root-to-leaf path 4->0 represents the number 40.<br>
Therefore, sum = 495 + 491 + 40 = 1026.
 

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 1000]`.
- `0 <= Node.val <= 9`
- The depth of the tree will not exceed `10`.

# Solution

The approach of the given C++ solution for the sum of all root-to-leaf numbers problem is to use a recursive function to traverse the tree and calculate the sum of all root-to-leaf numbers.

The algorithm is as follows:

1. Define a recursive function `sumNumber()`, which takes the following arguments:
    * `root`: The root node of the tree.
    * `val`: A string to store the current path from the root node to the current node.
    * `sum`: A reference to the variable that stores the sum of all root-to-leaf numbers.
2. If the root node is null, return.
3. Append the value of the root node to the string `val`.
4. If the root node is a leaf node, convert the string `val` to an integer and add it to the variable `sum`.
5. Recursively call the `sumNumber()` function on the left and right child nodes of the root node, passing in the updated string `val` and the reference to the variable `sum`.
6. Remove the value of the root node from the string `val`.
7. Return.

The main function of the solution simply calls the `sumNumber()` function on the root node of the tree, passing in an empty string and a reference to the variable `sum`. The variable `sum` will contain the sum of all root-to-leaf numbers in the tree after the `sumNumber()` function returns.

Here is a C++ implementation of the algorithm:

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    void sumNumber(TreeNode* root, string &val, int &sum){
        if(!root) return;
        val += to_string(root->val);

        if(!root->left && !root->right) sum += stoi(val);
        sumNumber(root->left, val, sum);
        sumNumber(root->right, val, sum);
        root->left = NULL;
        root->right = NULL;
        val.pop_back();
    }
public:
    int sumNumbers(TreeNode* root) {
        string val;
        int sum = 0;
        sumNumber(root, val, sum);
        return sum; 
    }
};
```

This solution is time-efficient and space-efficient. It uses `O(n)` time to traverse the tree and `O(h)` space to store the current path from the root node to the current node, where h is the height of the tree.
