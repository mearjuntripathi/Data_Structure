# [979. Distribute Coins in Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/distribute-coins-in-binary-tree/)

You are given the `root` of a binary tree with `n` nodes where each node in the tree has `node.val` coins. There are n coins in total throughout the whole tree.

In one move, we may choose two adjacent nodes and move one coin from one node to another. A move may be from parent to child, or from child to parent.

Return the minimum number of moves required to make every node have exactly one coin.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/01/18/tree1.png)

>**Input:** root = [3,0,0]<br>
**Output:** 2<br>
**Explanation:** From the root of the tree, we move one coin to its left child, and one coin to its right child.

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/01/18/tree2.png)

>**Input:** root = [0,3,0]<br>
**Output:** 3<br>
**Explanation:** From the left child of the root, we move two coins to the root [taking two moves]. Then, we move one coin from the root of the tree to the right child.
 

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the tree is `n`.
- `1 <= n <= 100`
- `0 <= Node.val <= n`
- The sum of all `Node.val` is `n`.

# Solution
**Approach:**

This solution to the Distribute Coins in Binary Tree problem uses a recursive approach to traverse the tree and calculate the number of coins that need to be moved at each node.

**Algorithm:**

```c++
class Solution {
    int moves = 0;

    int countMoves(TreeNode* root) {
        if (!root) return 0;

        int move = root->val - 1 + countMoves(root->left) + countMoves(root->right);

        // Nullify the left and right child nodes, as they have already been counted.
        root->left = NULL;
        root->right = NULL;

        // Update the number of moves needed.
        moves += abs(move);

        return move;
    }

public:
    int distributeCoins(TreeNode* root) {
        countMoves(root);
        return moves;
    }
};
```

**Explanation:**

The `countMoves()` function recursively traverses the tree and calculates the number of coins that need to be moved at each node. At each node, the function first calculates the number of coins that need to be moved from the current node to its left and right child nodes. It then updates the number of moves needed to include the number of coins that need to be moved from the current node to its parent node.

The `distributeCoins()` function simply calls the `countMoves()` function on the root node of the tree and returns the number of moves needed.

**Example:**

Consider the following binary tree:

```
    3
   / \
  0   0
```

The `distributeCoins()` function would return 2 for this tree, as 1 coin needs to be moved from the root node to its right child node and 1 coin needs to be moved from the root node to its parent node.
