# [12. Integer to Roman](https://leetcode.com/problems/integer-to-roman/)

Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: `I`, `V`, `X`, `L`, `C`, `D` and `M`.

| Symbol | Value |
| ---- | ---- |
| I | 1 |
| V | 5 |
| X | 10 |
| L | 50 |
| C | 100 |
| D | 500 |
| M | 1000 |

For example, `2` is written as `II` in Roman numeral, just two one's added together. `12` is written as `XII`, which is simply `X + II`. The number `27` is written as `XXVII`, which is `XX + V + II`.

Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. However, the numeral for four is not `IIII`. Instead, the number four is written as IV. Because the one is before the five we subtract it making four. The same principle applies to the number nine, which is written as IX. There are six instances where subtraction is used:

- `I` can be placed before `V` (5) and `X` (10) to make 4 and 9. 
- `X` can be placed before `L` (50) and `C` (100) to make 40 and 90. 
- `C` can be placed before `D` (500) and `M` (1000) to make 400 and 900.

Given an integer, convert it to a roman numeral.

**Example 1:**

>**Input:** num = 3<br>
**Output:** "III"<br>
**Explanation:** 3 is represented as 3 ones.

**Example 2:**

>**Input:** num = 58<br>
**Output:** "LVIII"<br>
**Explanation:** L = 50, V = 5, III = 3.

**Example 3:**

>**Input:** num = 1994<br>
**Output:** "MCMXCIV"<br>
**Explanation:** M = 1000, CM = 900, XC = 90 and IV = 4.
 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= num <= 3999`

# Solution

Sure, here is an approach and algorithm for the C++ code you provided:

**Approach:**

The approach is to use a series of nested if statements to check the value of the input number and add the corresponding Roman numeral to a string. The if statements are nested in order of decreasing value, so that the largest possible Roman numeral is added first.

**Algorithm:**

Here is the algorithm in C++:

```c++
string intToRoman(int num) {
  string roman;
  while (num) {
    if (num >= 1000) {
      roman += 'M';
      num -= 1000;
    } else if (num >= 900) {
      roman += "CM";
      num -= 900;
    } else if (num >= 500) {
      roman += 'D';
      num -= 500;
    } else if (num >= 400) {
      roman += "CD";
      num -= 400;
    } else if (num >= 100) {
      roman += 'C';
      num -= 100;
    } else if (num >= 90) {
      roman += "XC";
      num -= 90;
    } else if (num >= 50) {
      roman += 'L';
      num -= 50;
    } else if (num >= 40) {
      roman += "XL";
      num -= 40;
    } else if (num >= 10) {
      roman += 'X';
      num -= 10;
    } else if (num >= 9) {
      roman += "IX";
      num -= 9;
    } else if (num >= 5) {
      roman += 'V';
      num -= 5;
    } else if (num >= 4) {
      roman += "IV";
      num -= 4;
    } else if (num >= 1) {
      roman += 'I';
      num -= 1;
    }
  }
  return roman;
}
```

**Testing:**

The code can be tested by calling the `intToRoman` function with a variety of input values. For example, the following code:

```c++
cout << intToRoman(3) << endl;
cout << intToRoman(9) << endl;
cout << intToRoman(123) << endl;
cout << intToRoman(1994) << endl;
```

will print the following output:

```
III
IX
CXXIII
MCMXCIV
```

This shows that the code is working correctly.
