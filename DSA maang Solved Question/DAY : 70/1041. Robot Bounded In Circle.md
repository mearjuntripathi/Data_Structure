# [1041. Robot Bounded In Circle](https://leetcode.com/problems/robot-bounded-in-circle/)

On an infinite plane, a robot initially stands at `(0, 0)` and faces north. Note that:

- The north direction is the positive direction of the y-axis.
- The south direction is the negative direction of the y-axis.
- The east direction is the positive direction of the x-axis.
- The west direction is the negative direction of the x-axis.

The robot can receive one of three instructions:

- `"G"`: go straight 1 unit.
- `"L"`: turn 90 degrees to the left (i.e., anti-clockwise direction).
- `"R"`: turn 90 degrees to the right (i.e., clockwise direction).

The robot performs the `instructions` given in order, and repeats them forever.

Return `true` if and only if there exists a circle in the plane such that the robot never leaves the circle.

**Example 1:**

>**Input:** instructions = "GGLLGG"<br>
**Output:** true<br>
**Explanation:** The robot is initially at (0, 0) facing the north direction.<br>
"G": move one step. Position: (0, 1). Direction: North.<br>
"G": move one step. Position: (0, 2). Direction: North.<br>
"L": turn 90 degrees anti-clockwise. Position: (0, 2). Direction: West.<br>
"L": turn 90 degrees anti-clockwise. Position: (0, 2). Direction: South.<br>
"G": move one step. Position: (0, 1). Direction: South.<br>
"G": move one step. Position: (0, 0). Direction: South.<br>
Repeating the instructions, the robot goes into the cycle: (0, 0) --> (0, 1) --> (0, 2) --> (0, 1) --> (0, 0).<br>
Based on that, we return true.

**Example 2:**

>**Input:** instructions = "GG"<br>
**Output:** false<br>
**Explanation:** The robot is initially at (0, 0) facing the north direction.<br>
"G": move one step. Position: (0, 1). Direction: North.<br>
"G": move one step. Position: (0, 2). Direction: North.<br>
Repeating the instructions, keeps advancing in the north direction and does not go into cycles.<br>
Based on that, we return false.

**Example 3:**

>**Input:** instructions = "GL"<br>
**Output:** true<br>
**Explanation:** The robot is initially at (0, 0) facing the north direction.<br>
"G": move one step. Position: (0, 1). Direction: North.<br>
"L": turn 90 degrees anti-clockwise. Position: (0, 1). Direction: West.<br>
"G": move one step. Position: (-1, 1). Direction: West.<br>
"L": turn 90 degrees anti-clockwise. Position: (-1, 1). Direction: South.<br>
"G": move one step. Position: (-1, 0). Direction: South.<br>
"L": turn 90 degrees anti-clockwise. Position: (-1, 0). Direction: East.<br>
"G": move one step. Position: (0, 0). Direction: East.<br>
"L": turn 90 degrees anti-clockwise. Position: (0, 0). Direction: North.<br>
Repeating the instructions, the robot goes into the cycle: (0, 0) --> (0, 1) --> (-1, 1) --> (-1, 0) --> (0, 0).<br>
Based on that, we return true.
 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= instructions.length <= 100`
- `instructions[i]` is `'G'`, `'L'` or, `'R'`.

# Solution
Sure. Here is an approach and algorithm for the given solution in C++:

**Approach:**

1. Represent the four possible directions in a graph.
2. Initialize the direction, x-coordinate, and y-coordinate.
3. Iterate through the instructions, updating the direction, x-coordinate, and y-coordinate accordingly.
4. Return whether the robot has returned to its starting position or if the direction is not 0 after all instructions have been processed.

**Algorithm:**

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    bool isRobotBounded(string instructions) {
        int graph[4][2] = {{1, 0}, {0, 1}, {-1, 0}, {0, -1}};

        int di = 0, x = 0, y = 0;

        for (auto instruction : instructions) {
            switch (instruction) {
                case 'L':
                    di = (di + 1) % 4;
                    break;
                case 'R':
                    di = (di + 3) % 4;
                    break;
                default:
                    x = x + graph[di][0];
                    y = y + graph[di][1];
            }
        }
        if (x == 0 && y == 0 || di > 0)
            return true;
        return false;
    }
};
```

This algorithm efficiently determines whether the robot has returned to its starting position or if the direction is not 0 after all instructions have been processed.
