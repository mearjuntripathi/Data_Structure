# Solution
Sure, here is an approach and algorithm for the given solution in C++:

**Approach:**

The approach taken in this solution is to use the fact that the hour hand of a clock moves 30 degrees every hour, while the minute hand moves 6 degrees every minute. The difference between these two angles can be calculated by subtracting the angle of the minute hand from the angle of the hour hand. If the difference is greater than 180 degrees, then it is subtracted from 360 degrees to find the smallest angle between the two hands.

**Algorithm:**

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    double angleClock(int hour, int minutes) {
        // Calculate the angle of the hour hand
        hour %= 12;
        double anglePerHour = 30.0;
        double angleHour = hour * anglePerHour;

        // Calculate the angle of the minute hand
        double anglePerMinute = 6.0;
        double angleMinute = minutes * anglePerMinute;

        // Calculate the difference between the angles
        double diff = abs(angleMinute - angleHour);

        // Calculate the smallest angle between the two hands
        double ans = diff * 6.0;
        return (ans > 180) ? 360 - ans : ans;
    }
};
```

**Explanation:**

1. The `angleClock` function takes two parameters: `hour` and `minutes`.

2. The `hour` variable is used to calculate the angle of the hour hand. The `minutes` variable is used to calculate the angle of the minute hand.

3. The `diff` variable is used to calculate the difference between the angles of the hour hand and the minute hand.

4. The `ans` variable is used to store the smallest angle between the two hands.

5. The `return` statement returns the `ans` variable.
