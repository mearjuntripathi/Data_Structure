# [556. Next Greater Element III](https://leetcode.com/problems/next-greater-element-iii/)

Given a positive integer `n`, find the smallest integer which has exactly the same digits existing in the integer `n` and is greater in value than `n`. If no such positive integer exists, return `-1`.

Note that the returned integer should fit in **32-bit integer**, if there is a valid answer but it does not fit in **32-bit integer**, return `-1`.

**Example 1:**

>**Input:** n = 12<br>
**Output:** 21

**Example 2:**

>**Input:** n = 21<br>
**Output:** -1
 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= n <= 2^(31 - 1)`

# Solution

The approach used in the given solution is to find the smallest greater permutation of the given integer. This can be done by following the steps below:

1. Find the first digit from the right that is smaller than the digit next to it.
2. Find the smallest digit on the right side of the first digit that is greater than the first digit.
3. Swap the two digits.
4. Reverse the remaining digits.

The algorithm for the above approach is as follows:

```c++
int nextGreaterElement(int n) {
  string str = to_string(n);

  // Find the first digit from the right that is smaller than the digit next to it.
  int i = str.length() - 2;
  while (i >= 0 && str[i] >= str[i + 1])
    i--;

  if (i < 0) return -1; // No greater permutation is possible.

  // Find the smallest digit on the right side of the (i - 1)'th digit.
  int j = str.length() - 1;

  while (str[j] <= str[i]) j--;

  // Swap the two digits.
  swap(str[i], str[j]);

  // Reverse the remaining digits.
  reverse(str.begin() + i + 1, str.end());

  long long result = stoll(str); // Convert the string to a long long.

  // Check for integer overflow (32-bit limit).
  if (result > INT_MAX) {
    return -1;
  }

  return result;
}
```

This algorithm is efficient in terms of time and space. It uses O(n) time to find the next greater permutation of the given integer. It uses O(1) space to store the string representation of the integer and to reverse the remaining digits of the string.
