# [49. Group Anagrams](https://leetcode.com/problems/group-anagrams/)

Given an array of strings `strs`, group **the anagrams** together. You can return the answer in **any order**.

An **Anagram** is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

 
**Example 1:**

>**Input:** strs = ["eat","tea","tan","ate","nat","bat"]<br>
**Output:** [["bat"],["nat","tan"],["ate","eat","tea"]]

**Example 2:**

>**Input:** strs = [""]<br>
**Output:** [[""]]

**Example 3:**

>**Input:** strs = ["a"]<br>
**Output:** [["a"]]
 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= strs.length <= 1e4`
- `0 <= strs[i].length <= 100`
- `strs[i]` consists of lowercase English letters.

# Solution

The first approach to the group anagrams problem is a brute force approach. This approach works by iterating over the strings in the input array and comparing each string to every other string. If two strings are anagrams, they are added to the same group.

The following is a C++ implementation of the brute force approach:

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<string>> groupAnagrams(vector<string>& strs) {
        vector<vector<string>> groups;
        unordered_map<string, int> mp;
        int i = 0;
        for (auto str : strs) {
            vector<string> group;
            if (mp.count(str)) {
                i++;
                continue;
            }
            mp[str]++;
            group.push_back(str);
            for (int j = ++i; j < strs.size(); j++) {
                if (match(str, strs[j])) {
                    mp[strs[j]]++;
                    group.push_back(strs[j]);
                }
            }
            groups.push_back(group);
        }
        return groups;
    }

    inline bool match(string& s1, string& s2) {
        if (s1.size() != s2.size()) {
            return false;
        }
        short alfa[26] = {0};
        for (auto c : s1) {
            alfa[c - 'a']++;
        }
        for (auto c : s2) {
            if (alfa[c - 'a'] == 0) {
                return false;
            } else {
                alfa[c - 'a']--;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
};
```

The second approach to the group anagrams problem is a more optimized approach. This approach works by first sorting each string in the input array. Then, it iterates over the sorted strings and adds each string to the same group as all other strings that are sorted in the same way.

The following is a C++ implementation of the optimized approach:

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<string>> groupAnagrams(vector<string>& strs) {
        unordered_map<string, int> mp;
        vector<vector<string>> groups;
        for (auto& str : strs) {
            string s = str;
            sort(s.begin(), s.end());
            if (mp.count(s)) {
                groups[mp[s]].push_back(str);
            } else {
                mp[s] = groups.size();
                groups.push_back({str});
            }
        }
        return groups;
    }
};
```

The optimized approach is more efficient than the brute force approach because it only needs to compare each string to the sorted strings in the input array. This is a significant improvement, especially when the input array is large.

The brute-force approach is simple to implement, but it is inefficient. The optimized approach is more efficient, but it is also more complex to implement.

Which approach to use depends on the specific requirements of the problem. If time is a constraint, then the brute-force approach may be a good choice. However, if efficiency is a constraint, then the optimized approach is a better choice.
