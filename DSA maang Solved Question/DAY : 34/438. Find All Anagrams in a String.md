# [438. Find All Anagrams in a String](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-all-anagrams-in-a-string/)

Given two strings `s` and `p`, return an array of all the start indices of `p`'s anagrams in `s`. You may return the answer in **any order**.

An **Anagram** is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

**Example 1:**

>**Input:** s = "cbaebabacd", p = "abc"<br>
**Output:** [0,6]<br>
**Explanation:**<br>
The substring with start index = 0 is "cba", which is an anagram of "abc".<br>
The substring with start index = 6 is "bac", which is an anagram of "abc".

**Example 2:**

>**Input:** s = "abab", p = "ab"<br>
**Output:** [0,1,2]<br>
**Explanation:**<br>
The substring with start index = 0 is "ab", which is an anagram of "ab".<br>
The substring with start index = 1 is "ba", which is an anagram of "ab".<br>
The substring with start index = 2 is "ab", which is an anagram of "ab".
 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= s.length, p.length <= 3 * 1e4`
- `s` and `p` consist of lowercase English letters.

# Solution
This solution to the Find All Anagrams in a String problem uses the following approach:

1. Create an array `alfa` to store the frequency of each character in the pattern string `p`.
2. Create a variable `pos` to keep track of the start index of the current window in the input string `s`.
3. Iterate over the input string `s`:
    * If the current index `i` is less than `pos + pl`, where `pl` is the length of the pattern string `p`, decrement the frequency of the current character in `alfa`.
    * Otherwise:
        * Check if all the characters in `alfa` have a frequency of 0. If so, add the start index `pos` of the current window to the result vector.
        * Decrement the frequency of the character at index `pos` in `alfa`.
        * Increment the frequency of the character at index `i` in `alfa`.
        * Increment `pos`.
4. Check if all the characters in `alfa` have a frequency of 0. If so, add the start index `pos` of the current window to the result vector.
5. Return the result vector.

**Algorithm:**

```c++
vector<int> findAnagrams(string s, string p) {
  int pl = p.length();
  int sl = s.length();
  if (pl > sl) return {};
  int alfa[26] = {0};
  for (auto c : p) {
    alfa[c - 'a']++;
  }
  int pos = 0;
  vector<int> result;
  for (int i = 0; i < sl; i++) {
    if (i - pos < pl) {
      alfa[s[i] - 'a']--;
      continue;
    } else {
      int a;
      for (a = 0; a < 26; a++) {
        if (alfa[a] != 0) {
          break;
        }
      }
      if (a == 26) result.push_back(pos);
      alfa[s[pos++]-'a']++;
      alfa[s[i]-'a']--;
    }
  }
  int a;
  for (a = 0; a < 26; a++) {
    if (alfa[a] != 0) {
      break;
    }
  }
  if (a == 26) result.push_back(pos);
  return result;
}
```

This algorithm is time-efficient and space-efficient. It uses O(n) time to iterate over the input string and O(1) space to store the frequency of the characters in the pattern string.
