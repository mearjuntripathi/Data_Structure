# [8. String to Integer (atoi)](https://leetcode.com/problems/string-to-integer-atoi/)

Implement the `myAtoi(string s)` function, which converts a string to a `32-bit` signed integer (similar to C/C++'s `atoi` function).

The algorithm for `myAtoi(string s)` is as follows:

1. Read in and ignore any leading whitespace.
1. Check if the next character (if not already at the end of the string) is `'-'` or `'+'`. Read this character in if it is either. This determines if the final result is negative or positive respectively. Assume the result is positive if neither is present.
1. Read in next the characters until the next non-digit character or the end of the input is reached. The rest of the string is ignored.
1. Convert these digits into an integer (i.e. "`123" -> 123`, `"0032" -> 32`). If no digits were read, then the integer is `0`. Change the sign as necessary (from step 2).
1. If the integer is out of the 32-bit signed integer range `[-2^31, 2^31 - 1]`, then clamp the integer so that it remains in the range. Specifically, integers less than `-2^31` should be clamped to -231, and integers greater than `2^31 - 1` should be clamped to `2^31 - 1`.
1. Return the integer as the final result.

**Note:**

- Only the space character `' '` is considered a whitespace character.
- **Do not ignore** any characters other than the leading whitespace or the rest of the string after the digits.
 


**Example 1:**

>**Input:** s = "42"<br>
**Output:** 42<br>
**Explanation:** The underlined characters are what is read in, the caret is the current reader position.<br>
Step 1: "42" (no characters read because there is no leading whitespace)<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ^<br>
Step 2: "42" (no characters read because there is neither a '-' nor '+')<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ^<br>
Step 3: "42" ("42" is read in)<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ^<br>
The parsed integer is 42.<br>
Since 42 is in the range [-2^31, 2^31 - 1], the final result is 42.

**Example 2:**

>**Input:** s = "&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -42"<br>
**Output:** -42<br>

**Example 3:**

>**Input:** s = "4193 with words"<br>
**Output:** 4193<br>
 

**Constraints:**

- `0 <= s.length <= 200`
- `s` consists of English letters (lower-case and upper-case), digits (`0-9`), `' '`, `'+'`, `'-'`, and `'.'`.

# Solution
The approach and algorithm for the `myAtoi()` solution in C++ is as follows:

1. **Initialize variables.**
    * `num`: A long variable to store the converted integer value.
    * `n`: The length of the input string.
    * `sign`: A variable to store the sign of the converted integer value (1 for positive, -1 for negative).
    * `i`: An iterator variable to iterate over the input string.
2. **Ignore leading whitespace.**
    * While the current character in the input string is a whitespace character, increment the iterator variable.
3. **Check for a sign.**
    * If the current character in the input string is a plus sign (+) or a minus sign (-), store the corresponding sign in the `sign` variable and increment the iterator variable.
4. **Convert the numeric part of the string to an integer.**
    * While the current character in the input string is a digit, multiply the current value of `num` by 10 and add the current character to `num` after subtracting the ASCII value of the character '0'.
5. **Check for overflow.**
    * If the value of `num` is greater than the maximum allowed value for an integer, return the maximum allowed value for a positive integer if the sign is positive, or the minimum allowed value for a negative integer if the sign is negative.
6. **Return the converted integer value.**
    * Return the product of `num` and `sign`.

Here is a C++ implementation of the `myAtoi()` function using the above approach and algorithm:

```c++
int myAtoi(string s) {
  long num = 0; // crate a long variable to store a value
  int n = s.length(); // keep length of given string
  int sign = 1; // pridict sign as positive (1 for spositive 0 for negative)
  int i = 0; // iterator i

  while (s[i++] == ' '); // ignor all spaces
  --i;
  if (s[i] == '+' || s[i] == '-') // check sign if it given
    sign = (s[i++] == '+') ? 1 : 0; // update sign (1 for spositive 0 for negative)

  for (i; i < n; i++) { // run loop till length
    if (isdigit(s[i])) { // if no is digit
      num *= 10;
      num += s[i] - '0'; // we store it
    } else
      break; // if no is not an digit we breate it

    if (num > INT_MAX) // if num is out of integer range
      return sign ? INT_MAX : INT_MIN; // we return as their sign
  }
  return sign ? num : num * -1; // after all iteration we return num based on sign
}
```

This implementation of the `myAtoi()` function is time-efficient and space-efficient. It uses O(n) time to iterate over the input string and O(1) space to store the converted integer value.
