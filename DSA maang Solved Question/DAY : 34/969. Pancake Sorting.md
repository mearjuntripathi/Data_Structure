# [969. Pancake Sorting](https://leetcode.com/problems/pancake-sorting/)

Given an array of integers `arr`, sort the array by performing a series of **pancake flips**.

In one pancake flip we do the following steps:

- Choose an integer `k` where `1 <= k <= arr.length`.
- Reverse the sub-array `arr[0...k-1]` (**0-indexed**).

For example, if `arr = [3,2,1,4]` and we performed a pancake flip choosing `k = 3`, we reverse the sub-array `[3,2,1]`, so `arr = [1,2,3,4]` after the pancake flip at `k = 3`.

Return an array of the `k`-values corresponding to a sequence of pancake flips that sort `arr`. Any valid answer that sorts the array within `10 * arr.length` flips will be judged as correct.

**Example 1:**

>**Input:** arr = [3,2,4,1]<br>
**Output:** [4,2,4,3]<br>
**Explanation:** 
We perform 4 pancake flips, with k values 4, 2, 4, and 3.<br>
Starting state: arr = [3, 2, 4, 1]<br>
After 1st flip (k = 4): arr = [1, 4, 2, 3]<br>
After 2nd flip (k = 2): arr = [4, 1, 2, 3]<br>
After 3rd flip (k = 4): arr = [3, 2, 1, 4]<br>
After 4th flip (k = 3): arr = [1, 2, 3, 4], which is sorted.

**Example 2:**

>**Input:** arr = [1,2,3]<br>
**Output:** []<br>
**Explanation:** The input is already sorted, so there is no need to flip anything.<br>
Note that other answers, such as [3, 3], would also be accepted.
 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= arr.length <= 100`
- `1 <= arr[i] <= arr.length`
- All integers in arr are unique (i.e. `arr` is a permutation of the integers from `1` to `arr.length`).

# Solution
**Approach:**

The pancake sort algorithm works by repeatedly flipping the largest element in the array to the front of the array, and then flipping the entire array. This process is repeated until the array is sorted.

**Algorithm:**

```c++
vector<int> pancakeSort(vector<int>& arr) {
  vector<int> flip;
  while (arr.size()) {
    // Find the largest element in the array.
    int max_index = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i < arr.size(); ++i) {
      if (arr[i] > arr[max_index]) {
        max_index = i;
      }
    }

    // Flip the largest element to the front of the array.
    if (max_index != 0) {
      reverse(arr.begin(), arr.begin() + max_index + 1);
      flip.push_back(max_index + 1);
    }

    // Flip the entire array.
    reverse(arr.begin(), arr.end());
    flip.push_back(arr.size());

    // Remove the last element from the array.
    arr.pop_back();
  }

  return flip;
}
```

**Example:**

Suppose we have the following unsorted array:

```
arr = [5, 3, 2, 1, 4]
```

We can use the pancake sort algorithm to sort this array as follows:

```
# Find the largest element in the array and flip it to the front.
arr = [5, 3, 2, 1, 4]
reverse(arr.begin(), arr.begin() + 1)
# arr = [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]

# Flip the entire array.
arr = [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
reverse(arr.begin(), arr.end())
# arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Remove the last element from the array.
arr.pop_back()
# arr = [1, 2, 3, 4]

# Find the largest element in the array and flip it to the front.
arr = [1, 2, 3, 4]
reverse(arr.begin(), arr.begin() + 2)
# arr = [3, 1, 2, 4]

# Flip the entire array.
arr = [3, 1, 2, 4]
reverse(arr.begin(), arr.end())
# arr = [4, 2, 1, 3]

# Remove the last element from the array.
arr.pop_back()
# arr = [4, 2, 1]

# Find the largest element in the array and flip it to the front.
arr = [4, 2, 1]
reverse(arr.begin(), arr.begin() + 1)
# arr = [2, 4, 1]

# Flip the entire array.
arr = [2, 4, 1]
reverse(arr.begin(), arr.end())
# arr = [1, 4, 2]

# Remove the last element from the array.
arr.pop_back()
# arr = [1, 4]

# Find the largest element in the array and flip it to the front.
arr = [1, 4]
reverse(arr.begin(), arr.begin() + 1)
# arr = [4, 1]

# Flip the entire array.
arr = [4, 1]
reverse(arr.begin(), arr.end())
# arr = [1, 4]

# The array is now sorted.
```

The pancake sort algorithm is a simple and efficient sorting algorithm. It is particularly well-suited for sorting small arrays.
