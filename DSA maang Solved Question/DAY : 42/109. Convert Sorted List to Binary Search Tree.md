# [109. Convert Sorted List to Binary Search Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/convert-sorted-list-to-binary-search-tree/)

Given the `head` of a singly linked list where elements are sorted in ascending order, convert it to a  height-balanced binary search tree.


**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/08/17/linked.jpg)

>**Input:** head = [-10,-3,0,5,9]<br>
**Output:** [0,-3,9,-10,null,5]<br>
**Explanation:** One possible answer is [0,-3,9,-10,null,5], which represents the shown height balanced BST.

**Example 2:**

>**Input:** head = []<br>
**Output:** []
 

Constraints:

- The number of nodes in `head` is in the range `[0, 2 * 1e4]`.
- `-1e5 <= Node.val <= 1e5`

# Solution

The first approach to converting a sorted linked list to a balanced binary search tree (BST) in C++ is a brute force approach. It involves the following steps:

1. Convert the linked list to an array.
2. Sort the array.
3. Construct a BST from the sorted array.

The following C++ code implements this approach:

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    TreeNode* sortedListToBST(ListNode* head) {
        vector<int> arr;
        listtoarr(head, arr);
        return arrtoBST(arr, 0, arr.size() - 1);
    }

private:
    void listtoarr(ListNode* head, vector<int>& arr) {
        while (head) {
            arr.push_back(head->val);
            ListNode *temp = head;
            head = head->next;
            delete (temp);
        }
    }

    TreeNode* arrtoBST(vector<int>& nums, int start, int end) {
        if (start <= end) {
            int mid = start + (end - start) / 2;

            TreeNode *branch = new TreeNode(nums[mid]);
            branch->left = arrtoBST(nums, start, mid - 1);
            branch->right = arrtoBST(nums, mid + 1, end);
            return branch;
        }
        return NULL;
    }
};
```

This approach is simple to implement, but it is inefficient because it has to convert the linked list to an array and sort the array. This can take O(n log n) time and O(n) space, where n is the number of nodes in the linked list.

The second approach to converting a sorted linked list to a BST in C++ is a more efficient approach. It involves the following steps:

1. Find the middle node of the linked list.
2. Make the middle node the root of the BST.
3. Recursively construct the left and right subtrees of the BST from the remaining nodes in the linked list.

The following C++ code implements this approach:

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    TreeNode* sortedListToBST(ListNode* head) {
        if (head == NULL) {
            return NULL;
        }
        if (head->next == NULL) {
            return new TreeNode(head->val);
        }

        ListNode* fast = head->next;
        ListNode* slow = head;
        while (fast->next && fast->next->next) {
            fast = fast->next->next;
            slow = slow->next;
        }
        ListNode *mid = slow->next;
        TreeNode *branch = new TreeNode(mid->val);
        slow->next = NULL;
        branch->left = sortedListToBST(head);
        branch->right = sortedListToBST(mid->next);
        return branch;
    }
};
```

This approach is more efficient than the brute force approach because it does not have to convert the linked list to an array or sort the array. It only has to traverse the linked list once to find the middle node and construct the BST.

The time complexity of this approach is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the linked list. The space complexity is O(log n), where n is the number of nodes in the linked list. This is because the recursive calls to the `sortedListToBST()` function will only create a stack that is log n deep.
