# [1008. Construct Binary Search Tree from Preorder Traversal](https://leetcode.com/problems/construct-binary-search-tree-from-preorder-traversal/)

Given an array of integers preorder, which represents the preorder traversal of a BST (i.e., **binary search tree**), construct the tree and return its root.

It is **guaranteed** that there is always possible to find a binary search tree with the given requirements for the given test cases.

A binary search tree is a binary tree where for every node, any descendant of `Node.left` has a value strictly less than `Node.val`, and any descendant of `Node.right` has a value **strictly greater than** `Node.val`.

A **preorder traversal** of a binary tree displays the value of the node first, then traverses `Node.left`, then traverses `Node.right`.

**Example 1:**

>**Input:** preorder = [8,5,1,7,10,12]<br>
**Output:** [8,5,10,1,7,null,12]

**Example 2:**

>**Input:** preorder = [1,3]<br>
**Output:** [1,null,3]
 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= preorder.length <= 100`
- `1 <= preorder[i] <= 1000`
- All the values of preorder are **unique**.

# Solution

This C++ solution to the Construct Binary Search Tree from Preorder Traversal problem uses the following approach and algorithm:

**Approach**:

The approach is to recursively construct the binary search tree from the preorder traversal. The preorder traversal of a binary search tree starts with the root node, followed by all the nodes in the left subtree, and then all the nodes in the right subtree.

**Algorithm**:

The algorithm works as follows:

1. Create a pointer to the current node in the preorder traversal.
2. If the pointer is at the end of the preorder traversal, or the current value is greater than the range, then return `NULL`.
3. Create a new node with the current value.
4. Recursively construct the left subtree of the new node, passing in the preorder traversal pointer and the range of values for the left subtree (which is the current value).
5. Recursively construct the right subtree of the new node, passing in the preorder traversal pointer and the range of values for the right subtree (which is the maximum integer value).
6. Return the new node.

**C++ implementation**:

The following C++ code implements the above algorithm:

```c++
class Solution {
    TreeNode* bstFromPreorder(vector<int>& preorder, int& idx, int range) {
        if (idx == preorder.size() || range < preorder[idx]) {
            return nullptr;
        }

        TreeNode* root = new TreeNode(preorder[idx++]);
        root->left = bstFromPreorder(preorder, idx, root->val);
        root->right = bstFromPreorder(preorder, idx, range);
        return root;
    }
public:
    TreeNode* bstFromPreorder(vector<int>& preorder) {
        int idx = 0;
        return bstFromPreorder(preorder, idx, INT_MAX);
    }
};
```

This solution is time-efficient and space-efficient. It uses O(n) time and O(h) space, where `n` is the number of nodes in the tree and `h` is the height of the tree.
