# [890. Find and Replace Pattern](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-and-replace-pattern/)

Given a list of strings `words` and a string `pattern`, return a list of `words[i]` that match `pattern`. You may return the answer in any order.

A word matches the pattern if there exists a permutation of letters `p` so that after replacing every letter `x` in the pattern with `p(x)`, we get the desired word.

Recall that a permutation of letters is a bijection from letters to letters: every letter maps to another letter, and no two letters map to the same letter.

**Example 1:**

>**Input:** words = ["abc","deq","mee","aqq","dkd","ccc"], pattern = "abb"<br>
**Output:** ["mee","aqq"]<br>
**Explanation:** "mee" matches the pattern because there is a permutation {a -> m, b -> e, ...}. <br>
"ccc" does not match the pattern because {a -> c, b -> c, ...} is not a permutation, since a and b map to the same letter.

**Example 2:**

>**Input:** words = ["a","b","c"], pattern = "a"<br>
**Output:** ["a","b","c"]
 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= pattern.length <= 20`
- `1 <= words.length <= 50`
- `words[i].length == pattern.length`
- `pattern` and `words[i]` are lowercase English letters.

# Solution

**Approach:**

The approach taken by the solution is to first convert the pattern string into a unique cipher string by mapping each character in the pattern to a unique alphabet. This is done using the `makePattern()` function, which takes a string as input and returns a string as output. The function works by creating an array of 26 characters, initialized to all zeros. Then, it iterates over the input string and for each character, it checks if it has already been mapped to an alphabet. If not, it maps the character to the next unused alphabet and increments the alphabet counter. Otherwise, it returns the mapped alphabet.

Once the pattern string has been converted into a cipher string, the solution compares it to each word in the `words` vector to see if it matches. This is done using the `if(pattern == makePattern(word))` statement. If the cipher strings match, then the word is added to the `matched` vector.

**Algorithm:**

The algorithm for the `findAndReplacePattern()` function is as follows:

1. Convert the pattern string into a unique cipher string using the `makePattern()` function.
2. Iterate over the `words` vector and compare each word to the cipher string using the `if(pattern == makePattern(word))` statement.
3. If the cipher strings match, then add the word to the `matched` vector.
4. Return the `matched` vector.

**Example:**

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    vector<string> findAndReplacePattern(vector<string>& words, string &pattern) {
        string cipher = makePattern(pattern);

        vector<string> matched;

        for(auto &word : words) {
            if(cipher == makePattern(word)) {
                matched.push_back(word);
            }
        }

        return matched;
    }

private:
    string makePattern(string &word) {
        char alfa[26] = {0};
        char alphabet = 'a';
        string pattern = "";

        for(auto ch : word) {
            if(alfa[ch-'a'] == 0) {
                alfa[ch-'a'] = alphabet;
                alphabet++;
            }

            pattern += alfa[ch-'a'];
        }

        return pattern;
    }
};
```

```c++
int main() {
    Solution solution;

    vector<string> words = {"abc", "deq", "mee", "aqq", "dkd", "ccc"};
    string pattern = "abb";

    vector<string> matched = solution.findAndReplacePattern(words, pattern);

    for(auto &word : matched) {
        cout << word << endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

Output:

```
mee
aqq
```
