# [523. Continuous Subarray Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/continuous-subarray-sum/)

Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`, return `true` if `nums` has a good subarray or `false` otherwise.

A good subarray is a subarray where:

- its length is at least two, and
- the sum of the elements of the subarray is a multiple of `k`.

**Note that:**

- A **subarray** is a contiguous part of the array.
- An integer `x` is a multiple of `k` if there exists an integer `n` such that `x = n * k`. `0` is always a multiple of `k`.
 


**Example 1:**

>**Input:** nums = [23,2,4,6,7], k = 6<br>
**Output:** true<br>
**Explanation:** [2, 4] is a continuous subarray of size 2 whose elements sum up to 6.

**Example 2:**

>**Input:** nums = [23,2,6,4,7], k = 6<br>
**Output:** true<br>
**Explanation:** [23, 2, 6, 4, 7] is an continuous subarray of size 5 whose elements sum up to 42.
42 is a multiple of 6 because 42 = 7 * 6 and 7 is an integer.

**Example 3:**

>**Input:** nums = [23,2,6,4,7], k = 13<br>
**Output:** false
 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 1e5`
- `0 <= nums[i] <= 1e9`
- `0 <= sum(nums[i]) <= 2^31 - 1`
- `1 <= k <= 2^31 - 1`

# Solution

The `checkSubarraySum` function takes a vector of integers and an integer `k` as input and returns `true` if there exists a subarray of the vector whose sum is divisible by `k`, and `false` otherwise.

The approach used in this solution is to use a hash table to store the prefix sums of the vector. We start by initializing an empty hash table and a variable `curr_sum` to 0. Then, we iterate through the vector, keeping track of the current sum `curr_sum`. For each element in the vector, we update `curr_sum` and then check if the hash table contains a key equal to `curr_sum` modulo `k`. If it does, then we have found a subarray whose sum is divisible by `k` and we can return `true`. Otherwise, we add the current sum to the hash table.

Here is a more detailed algorithm for the `checkSubarraySum` function:

```c++
bool checkSubarraySum(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
  // Create an empty hash table.
  unordered_set<int> st;

  // Initialize the current sum to 0.
  int curr_sum = 0;

  // Iterate through the vector, keeping track of the current sum.
  for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++) {
    // Update the current sum.
    curr_sum = (curr_sum + nums[i]) % k;

    // Check if the hash table contains a key equal to the current sum modulo k.
    if (st.find(curr_sum) != st.end()) {
      // If it does, then we have found a subarray whose sum is divisible by k.
      return true;
    }

    // Add the current sum to the hash table.
    st.insert(curr_sum);
  }

  // If we reach this point, then we have not found a subarray whose sum is divisible by k.
  return false;
}
```

Here is an example of how to use the `checkSubarraySum` function:

```c++
vector<int> nums = {23, 2, 4, 6, 7};
int k = 6;

bool result = checkSubarraySum(nums, k);

if (result) {
  cout << "There exists a subarray whose sum is divisible by " << k << endl;
} else {
  cout << "There does not exist a subarray whose sum is divisible by " << k << endl;
}
```

Output:

```
There exists a subarray whose sum is divisible by 6
```
