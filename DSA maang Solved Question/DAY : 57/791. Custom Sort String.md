# [791. Custom Sort String](https://leetcode.com/problems/custom-sort-string/)

You are given two strings order and s. All the characters of `order` are unique and were sorted in some custom order previously.

Permute the characters of `s` so that they match the `order` that order was sorted. More specifically, if a character `x` occurs before a character `y` in order, then `x` should occur before `y` in the permuted string.

Return any permutation of `s` that satisfies this property.

**Example 1:**

>**Input:** order = "cba", s = "abcd"<br>
**Output:** "cbad"<br>
**Explanation:** <br>
"a", "b", "c" appear in order, so the order of "a", "b", "c" should be "c", "b", and "a". <br>
Since "d" does not appear in order, it can be at any position in the returned string. "dcba", "cdba", "cbda" are also valid outputs.

**Example 2:**

>**Input:** order = "cbafg", s = "abcd"<br>
**Output:** "cbad"
 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= order.length <= 26`
- `1 <= s.length <= 200`
- `order` and `s` consist of lowercase English letters.
- All the characters of `order` are unique.

# Solution
**Approach**

The approach to this solution is to use a count array to store the number of occurrences of each character in the input string `s`. We then iterate over the order string `order` and append each character to the sorted string `sorted` as many times as it appears in the count array. Finally, we iterate over the input string `s` again and append any remaining characters to the sorted string.

**Algorithm**

1. Initialize a count array `alfa` of size 26, where `alfa[i]` represents the number of occurrences of the character `'a'+i` in the input string `s`.
2. Iterate over the input string `s` and increment the corresponding element in the count array `alfa` for each character.
3. Initialize an empty string `sorted`.
4. Iterate over the order string `order`.
    * For each character `ch` in the order string `order`:
        * Append the character `ch` to the sorted string `sorted` as many times as it appears in the count array `alfa`.
        * Decrement the corresponding element in the count array `alfa` by 1.
5. Iterate over the input string `s`.
    * For each character `ch` in the input string `s`:
        * If the corresponding element in the count array `alfa` is greater than 0:
            * Append the character `ch` to the sorted string `sorted`.
            * Decrement the corresponding element in the count array `alfa` by 1.
6. Return the sorted string `sorted`.

**Example**

```c++
string customSortString(string &order, string &s) {
    int alfa[26] = {0};
    for(auto ch : s)
        alfa[ch-'a']++;

    string sorted = "";

    for(auto ch : order){
        while(alfa[ch-'a']){
            sorted += ch; 
            alfa[ch-'a']--;
        }
    }
    for(auto ch : s){
        while(alfa[ch-'a']){
            sorted += ch;
            alfa[ch-'a']--;
        }
    }
    return sorted;
}
```

**Input:**

```
order = "cba"
s = "abcd"
```

**Output:**

```
"cbad"
```

**Explanation:**

The order string `order` specifies that the characters `'c'`, `'b'`, and `'a'` should appear in the sorted string in that order. The input string `s` contains the characters `'a'`, `'b'`, `'c'`, and `'d'`.

The algorithm first initializes the count array `alfa` to all zeros. Then, it iterates over the input string `s` and increments the corresponding element in the count array for each character.

Next, the algorithm initializes the sorted string `sorted` to an empty string. Then, it iterates over the order string `order`. For each character `ch` in the order string `order`, the algorithm appends the character `ch` to the sorted string `sorted` as many times as it appears in the count array `alfa`. Then, it decrements the corresponding element in the count array `alfa` by 1.

Finally, the algorithm iterates over the input string `s` again. For each character `ch` in the input string `s`, the algorithm checks if the corresponding element in the count array `alfa` is greater than 0. If it is, the algorithm appends the character `ch` to the sorted string `sorted`. Then, it decrements the corresponding element in the count array `alfa` by 1.

The algorithm returns the sorted string `sorted`.
