# [532. K-diff Pairs in an Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/k-diff-pairs-in-an-array/)

Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `k`, return the number of unique k-diff pairs in the array.

A k-diff pair is an integer pair (`nums[i], nums[j])`, where the following are true:

- `0 <= i, j < nums.length`
- `i != j`
- `|nums[i] - nums[j]| == k`

**Notice** that `|val|` denotes the absolute value of `val`.

**Example 1:**

>**Input:** nums = [3,1,4,1,5], k = 2<br>
**Output:** 2<br>
**Explanation:** There are two 2-diff pairs in the array, (1, 3) and (3, 5).
Although we have two 1s in the input, we should only return the number of unique pairs.

**Example 2:**

>**Input:** nums = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 1<br>
**Output:** 4<br>
**Explanation:** There are four 1-diff pairs in the array, (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4) and (4, 5).

**Example 3:**

>**Input:** nums = [1,3,1,5,4], k = 0<br>
**Output:** 1<br>
**Explanation:** There is one 0-diff pair in the array, (1, 1).
 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 1e4`
- `-1e7 <= nums[i] <= 1e7`
- `0 <= k <= 1e7`

# Solution

The approach of the given solution in C++ is to use a hash table to store the elements of the array and their frequencies. The algorithm is as follows:

1. Create an unordered map to store the elements of the array and their frequencies.
2. Iterate over the array and insert each element into the unordered map, incrementing its frequency if it already exists.
3. Iterate over the hash table and for each element, check if there exists another element in the hash table whose key is either equal to the current element's key plus `k` or equal to the current element's key minus `k` (depending on the value of `k`). If such an element exists, increment the count of pairs.
4. Return the count of pairs.

Here is a more detailed explanation of the algorithm:

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int findPairs(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        int pair = 0;
        unordered_map<int,int> mp;
        for(auto num : nums)
            mp[num]++;
        for(auto it : mp){
            if((k > 0 && mp.find(it.first+k) != mp.end()) || (k == 0 && it.second > 1))
                pair++;
        }
        return pair;
    }
};
```

* **Line 1:** The `Solution` class is declared.
* **Line 3:** The `findPairs()` function is declared. It takes two arguments: a vector of integers (`nums`) and an integer (`k`). It returns the number of pairs in the vector whose difference is equal to `k`.
* **Line 5:** The `int pair = 0` variable is declared to store the count of pairs.
* **Line 6:** An unordered map (`unordered_map<int,int> mp`) is declared to store the elements of the array and their frequencies.
* **Line 7:** The `for(auto num : nums)` loop iterates over the array and inserts each element into the unordered map, incrementing its frequency if it already exists.
* **Line 9:** The `for(auto it : mp)` loop iterates over the hash table and for each element, checks if there exists another element in the hash table whose key is either equal to the current element's key plus `k` or equal to the current element's key minus `k` (depending on the value of `k`). If such an element exists, the `pair` variable is incremented.
* **Line 11:** The `return pair;` statement returns the count of pairs.

**Example:**

```c++
vector<int> nums = {1, 3, 2, 1, 5};
int k = 2;

Solution solution;
int pair = solution.findPairs(nums, k);

cout << pair << endl; // Outputs 2
```

This example shows that the given solution correctly finds the number of pairs in the vector whose difference is equal to `k`.
