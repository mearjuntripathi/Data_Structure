# [1161. Maximum Level Sum of a Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-level-sum-of-a-binary-tree/)

Given the `root` of a binary tree, the level of its root is `1`, the level of its children is `2`, and so on.

Return the **smallest** level `x` such that the sum of all the values of nodes at level x is maximal.

 


**Example 1:**

>**Input:** root = [1,7,0,7,-8,null,null]<br>
**Output:** 2<br>
**Explanation:** <br>
Level 1 sum = 1.<br>
Level 2 sum = 7 + 0 = 7.<br>
Level 3 sum = 7 + -8 = -1.<br>
So we return the level with the maximum sum which is level 2.

**Example 2:**

>**Input:** root = [989,null,10250,98693,-89388,null,null,null,-32127]<br>
**Output:** 2
 

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 1e4]`.
- `-1e5 <= Node.val <= 1e5`

# Solution

Sure, here is the approach and algorithm for the `maxLevelSum()` function in C++:

**Approach:**

The approach is to use a queue to traverse the tree level by level. At each level, we calculate the sum of all the nodes in that level. We keep track of the maximum sum and the level at which it occurs. At the end, we return the level at which the maximum sum occurred.

**Algorithm:**

```c++
int maxLevelSum(TreeNode* root) {
  // Create a queue to store the nodes of the tree.
  queue<TreeNode*> q;

  // Initialize the maximum sum and the level at which it occurs.
  long long max_sum = root->val;
  int max_level = 1;

  // Enqueue the root node.
  q.push(root);

  // While the queue is not empty:
  while (!q.empty()) {
    // Get the current level.
    int level = q.size();

    // Calculate the sum of all the nodes in the current level.
    long long sum = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < level; i++) {
      // Get the current node.
      TreeNode* node = q.front();
      q.pop();

      // Add the value of the current node to the sum.
      sum += node->val;

      // Enqueue the left and right child nodes of the current node, if they exist.
      if (node->left) {
        q.push(node->left);
      }
      if (node->right) {
        q.push(node->right);
      }
    }

    // If the sum of the current level is greater than the maximum sum, update the
    // maximum sum and the level at which it occurs.
    if (sum > max_sum) {
      max_sum = sum;
      max_level = level;
    }
  }

  // Return the level at which the maximum sum occurred.
  return max_level;
}
```

This algorithm is time-efficient and space-efficient. It uses O(n) time and O(h) space, where `n` is the number of nodes in the tree and `h` is the height of the tree.
