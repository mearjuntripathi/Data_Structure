# [124. Binary Tree Maximum Path Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-maximum-path-sum/)

A **path** in a binary tree is a sequence of nodes where each pair of adjacent nodes in the sequence has an edge connecting them. A node can only appear in the sequence at most once. Note that the path does not need to pass through the root.

The **path sum** of a path is the sum of the node's values in the path.

Given the `root` of a binary tree, return the maximum **path sum** of any **non-empty path**.

**Example 1:**

>**Input:** root = [1,2,3]<br>
**Output:** 6<br>
**Explanation:** The optimal path is 2 -> 1 -> 3 with a path sum of 2 + 1 + 3 = 6.

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/10/13/exx2.jpg)

>**Input:** root = [-10,9,20,null,null,15,7]<br>
**Output:** 42<br>
**Explanation:** The optimal path is 15 -> 20 -> 7 with a path sum of 15 + 20 + 7 = 42.
 

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 3 * 1e4]`.
- `-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000`

# Solution

The approach of the given C++ solution to the Maximum Path Sum in Binary Tree problem is to recursively traverse the tree and find the maximum path sum that goes through each node. The maximum path sum is the sum of the values of the nodes in the path, including the current node.

The algorithm is as follows:

1. Define a recursive function `maxPathSum()` that takes two arguments:

    * `root`: The root node of the subtree to traverse.
    * `maxsum`: A pointer to a variable that stores the maximum path sum found so far.

2. The `maxPathSum()` function works as follows:

    * If the `root` node is `NULL`, return 0.
    * Find the maximum path sums of the left and right subtrees of the `root` node.
    * Update the `maxsum` variable if the maximum path sum of the left and right subtrees plus the value of the `root` node is greater than the current value of `maxsum`.
    * Set the left and right child pointers of the `root` node to `NULL`.
    * Return the maximum path sum of the left and right subtrees plus the value of the `root` node.

3. In the `main()` function, call the `maxPathSum()` function with the root node of the tree as the argument.
4. Return the value of the `maxsum` variable.

Here is a C++ implementation of the algorithm:

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int maxPathSum(TreeNode* root) {
        int maxsum = INT_MIN;
        maxPathSum(root, maxsum);
        return maxsum;
    }

private:
    int maxPathSum(TreeNode* root, int &maxsum) {
        if (!root) return 0;

        int left = max(0, maxPathSum(root->left, maxsum));
        int right = max(0, maxPathSum(root->right, maxsum));

        maxsum = max(maxsum, left + right + root->val);
        root->left = NULL;
        root->right = NULL;

        return max(left, right) + root->val;
    }
};
```

This algorithm is efficient because it only traverses the tree once. It also uses constant space, as it only needs to store the maximum path sum found so far.
