# [2096. Step-By-Step Directions From a Binary Tree Node to Another](https://leetcode.com/problems/step-by-step-directions-from-a-binary-tree-node-to-another/)

You are given the `root` of a binary tree with n nodes. Each node is uniquely assigned a value from `1` to `n`. You are also given an integer `startValue` representing the value of the start node s, and a different integer `destValue` representing the value of the destination node `t`.

Find the shortest path starting from node `s` and ending at node `t`. Generate step-by-step directions of such path as a string consisting of only the uppercase letters `'L'`, `'R'`, and `'U'`. Each letter indicates a specific direction:

- 'L' means to go from a node to its left child node.
- 'R' means to go from a node to its right child node.
- 'U' means to go from a node to its parent node.

Return the step-by-step directions of the shortest path from node `s` to node `t`.

**Example 1:**

>**Input:** root = [5,1,2,3,null,6,4], startValue = 3, destValue = 6<br>
**Output:** "UURL"<br>
**Explanation:** The shortest path is: 3 → 1 → 5 → 2 → 6.

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/11/15/eg2.png)

>**Input:** root = [2,1], startValue = 2, destValue = 1<br>
**Output:** "L"<br>
**Explanation:** The shortest path is: 2 → 1.
 

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the tree is `n`.
- `2 <= n <= 1e5`
- `1 <= Node.val <= n`
- All the values in the tree are unique.
- `1 <= startValue, destValue <= n`
- `startValue != destValue`

# Solution

The approach used in this C++ solution to the get directions problem is to first find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of the two nodes `startValue` and `destValue`. Once the LCA is found, the algorithm uses a recursive function to find the path from the LCA to each of the two nodes, starting at the LCA. The path is encoded as a string, where each character represents a direction, either `L` (left) or `R` (right).

The algorithm works as follows:

1. Find the LCA of the two nodes `startValue` and `destValue`.
2. Recursively find the path from the LCA to each of the two nodes, starting at the LCA.
3. Encode the paths as strings.
4. Reverse the path to the start node, `startValue`.
5. Concatenate the two paths, separated by a `U` character (up).
6. Return the concatenated path.

The recursive function to find the path from the LCA to a node is as follows:

```c++
bool direction(TreeNode *root, int &target, string &path){
    if(!root) 
        return false;
    if(root->val == target)
        return true;
        
    path += 'L';
    if(direction(root->left, target, path)) return true;
    path.pop_back();

    path += 'R';
    if(direction(root->right, target, path)) return true;
    path.pop_back();
    return false;
}
```

This function takes three arguments:

* `root`: The root node of the subtree to search.
* `target`: The value of the node to find.
* `path`: A string that encodes the path from the root node to the target node, so far.

The function returns `true` if the target node is found in the subtree rooted at `root`, and `false` otherwise. If the target node is found, the `path` string is updated to encode the path from the root node to the target node.

The following is a C++ implementation of the `getDirections` function:

```c++
class Solution {
    TreeNode* LCA(TreeNode *root, int &start, int &end){
        if(!root || root->val == start || root->val == end)
            return root;
        TreeNode *left = LCA(root->left, start, end);
        TreeNode *right = LCA(root->right, start, end);

        if(left && right)
            return root;
        
        return left != NULL ? left : right;
    }

    bool direction(TreeNode *root, int &target, string &path){
        if(!root) 
            return false;
        if(root->val == target)
            return true;
        
        path += 'L';
        if(direction(root->left, target, path)) return true;
        path.pop_back();

        path += 'R';
        if(direction(root->right, target, path)) return true;
        path.pop_back();
        return false;
    }

public:
    string getDirections(TreeNode* root, int &startValue, int &destValue) {
        root = LCA(root, startValue, destValue);
        string start;
        string dest;
        direction(root, startValue, start);
        direction(root, destValue, dest);
        for(auto &s : start) s = 'U';
        return start + dest;
    }
};
```

This solution is efficient in terms of both time and space. The time complexity is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree. This is because the algorithm needs to visit each node in the tree at most once. The space complexity is O(h), where h is the height of the tree. This is because the algorithm needs to store the path from the LCA to each of the two nodes, which can be as long as the height of the tree.
