# [90. Subsets II](https://leetcode.com/problems/subsets-ii/)

Given an integer array `nums` that may contain duplicates, return all possible 
subsets (the power set).

The solution set must not contain duplicate subsets. Return the solution in any order.

**Example 1:**

>**Input:** nums = [1,2,2]<br>
**Output:** [[],[1],[1,2],[1,2,2],[2],[2,2]]

**Example 2:**

>**Input:** nums = [0]<br>
**Output:** [[],[0]]
 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 10`
- `-10 <= nums[i] <= 10`

# Solution
Sure, here is an algorithm, approach, and C++ code for finding all subsets of a set that may contain duplicate elements:

**Algorithm**

The algorithm uses backtracking to generate all subsets of the input set. Backtracking is a recursive algorithm that explores all possible paths in a search tree. In this case, the search tree is the set of all possible subsets of the input set. Each node in the search tree represents a subset of the input set. The algorithm starts at the root node, which represents the empty set. It then recursively generates all possible children of the current node, which are the subsets of the input set that can be formed by adding an element from the input set to the current subset. The algorithm stops when it reaches a node that represents the entire input set.

**Approach**

The approach is to use a set to store the generated subsets. This ensures that each subset is only generated once, even if it contains duplicate elements.

**C++ Code**

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <set>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> subsetsWithDup(vector<int>& nums) {
        vector<vector<int>> powerset;
        vector<int> subset;
        sort(nums.begin(), nums.end());
        set<vector<int>> st;
        backtraking(st, subset, nums, 0);
        for(auto it : st)
            powerset.push_back(it);
        return powerset;
    }

private:
    void backtraking(set<vector<int>> &powerset, vector<int> &subset, vector<int> &nums, const int &idx) {
        powerset.insert(subset);
        for (int i = idx; i < nums.size(); i++) {
            subset.push_back(nums[i]);
            backtraking(powerset, subset, nums, i + 1);
            subset.pop_back();
        }
    }
};
```

**Explanation of C++ Code**

The C++ code implements the backtracking algorithm to generate all subsets of the input set. The `backtraking()` function takes four arguments:

* `powerset`: A reference to a set that will store the generated subsets.
* `subset`: A vector that represents the current subset.
* `nums`: A vector that represents the input set.
* `idx`: The index of the current element in the input set.

The `backtraking()` function first inserts the current subset into the powerset. Then, it recursively generates all possible children of the current subset. Each child subset is formed by adding an element from the input set to the current subset. The `backtraking()` function stops when it reaches a node that represents the entire input set.

The `subsetsWithDup()` function first sorts the input set to make it easier to generate all possible subsets. Then, it calls the `backtraking()` function to generate all subsets of the input set. The `backtraking()` function stores the generated subsets in a set, which ensures that each subset is only generated once. Finally, the `subsetsWithDup()` function returns a vector of all subsets of the input set.

I hope this helps!
