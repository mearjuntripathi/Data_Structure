# [78. Subsets](https://leetcode.com/problems/subsets/)

Given an integer array `nums` of unique elements, return all possible subsets (the power set).

The solution set must not contain duplicate subsets. Return the solution in any order.

**Example 1:**

>**Input:** nums = [1,2,3]<br>
**Output:** [[],[1],[2],[1,2],[3],[1,3],[2,3],[1,2,3]]

**Example 2:**

>**Input:** nums = [0]<br>
**Output:** [[],[0]]
 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 10`
- `-10 <= nums[i] <= 10`
- All the numbers of `nums` are unique.

# Solution
Sure, here is an algorithm and approach for the problem of finding all subsets of a set of integers, as well as the code in C++:

**Algorithm**

The algorithm uses a backtracking approach to find all subsets of a set of integers. The backtracking function takes four arguments:

* `powerset`: A vector of vectors of integers, where each vector represents a subset of the input set.
* `subset`: A vector of integers, which represents the current subset being constructed.
* `nums`: The vector of integers representing the input set.
* `idx`: The index of the next element to consider in the input set.

The backtracking function first adds the current subset to the `powerset`. Then, for each element in the input set starting from the current index, the function adds the element to the `subset` and recursively calls itself to find all subsets of the remaining elements in the input set. After the recursive call, the function removes the element from the `subset`.

**Approach**

The approach is to recursively explore all possible subsets of the input set. The backtracking function keeps track of the current subset being constructed and recursively calls itself to find all subsets of the remaining elements in the input set. This ensures that all possible subsets are considered.

**Code in C++**

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> subsets(vector<int>& nums) {
        vector<vector<int>> powerset;
        vector<int> subset;
        backtracking(powerset, subset, nums, 0);
        return powerset;
    }

private:
    void backtracking(vector<vector<int>> &powerset, vector<int> &subset, vector<int> &nums, int idx) {
        powerset.push_back(subset);
        for (int i = idx; i < nums.size(); i++) {
            subset.push_back(nums[i]);
            backtracking(powerset, subset, nums, i + 1);
            subset.pop_back();
        }
    }
};
```

This code implements the backtracking algorithm described above. The `subsets` function takes a vector of integers as input and returns a vector of vectors of integers, where each vector represents a subset of the input set. The `backtracking` function is a recursive function that takes four arguments:

* `powerset`: A reference to the vector of vectors of integers that will store the results.
* `subset`: A reference to the vector of integers that represents the current subset being constructed.
* `nums`: A reference to the vector of integers that represents the input set.
* `idx`: The index of the next element to consider in the input set.

The `backtracking` function first adds the current subset to the `powerset`. Then, for each element in the input set starting from the current index, the function adds the element to the `subset` and recursively calls itself to find all subsets of the remaining elements in the input set. After the recursive call, the function removes the element from the `subset`.

The `subsets` function first initializes an empty vector of vectors of integers `powerset`. Then, it calls the `backtracking` function with the empty vector `subset`, the input set `nums`, and the index `0`. The `backtracking` function will recursively call itself to find all subsets of the input set, and the results will be stored in the `powerset` vector. Finally, the `subsets` function returns the `powerset` vector.

I hope this helps!
