# [238. Product of Array Except Self](https://leetcode.com/problems/product-of-array-except-self/)

Given an integer array `nums`, return an array answer such that `answer[i]` is equal to the product of all the elements of `nums` except `nums[i]`.

The product of any prefix or suffix of `nums` is guaranteed to fit in a **32-bit** integer.

You must write an algorithm that runs in `O(n)` time and without using the division operation.

 


**Example 1:**

>**Input:** nums = [1,2,3,4]<br>
**Output:** [24,12,8,6]

**Example 2:**

>**Input:** nums = [-1,1,0,-3,3]<br>
**Output:** [0,0,9,0,0]
 

**Constraints:**

- `2 <= nums.length <= 105`
- `-30 <= nums[i] <= 30`
- The product of any prefix or suffix of `nums` is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.
 

**Follow up:** Can you solve the problem in `O(1)` extra space complexity? (The output array does not count as extra space for space complexity analysis.)

# Solution

The given code aims to find the product of all elements in an input vector except for the element at the current index. If the input vector contains zero(s), the result for those indices should be 0. The code also handles the case where there are multiple zeros in the input vector.

Here's an approach and algorithm for this code:

**Approach:**

1. Initialize two variables: `zero` to keep track of the number of zeros encountered in the input vector, and `tmul` to store the product of all non-zero elements in the vector.
2. Iterate through the input vector `nums`, and for each element:
   - If the element is non-zero, multiply it with `tmul`.
   - If the element is zero, check if `zero` is already non-zero (meaning there are multiple zeros). In this case, set `tmul` to 0 and break from the loop. Otherwise, increment `zero`.
3. Iterate through the `nums` vector again, and for each element:
   - If the element is non-zero and `zero` is greater than 0 (indicating the presence of zeros), set the element to 0.
   - If the element is non-zero, divide `tmul` by the element and set the element to this result.
   - If the element is zero, set the element to `tmul` (since all other elements are multiplied by zero in this case).
4. Return the modified `nums` vector as the result.

**Algorithm:**

```cpp
vector<int> productExceptSelf(vector<int>& nums) {
    int zero = 0;   // Count of zeros in the input vector
    int tmul = 1;   // Product of all non-zero elements

    // Calculate the product of all non-zero elements and count zeros
    for (auto num : nums) {
        if (num)
            tmul *= num;
        else {
            if (zero) {
                tmul = 0;
                break;
            }
            zero++;
        }
    }

    // Modify the input vector according to the approach
    for (auto &num : nums) {
        if (num)
            num = (zero > 0) ? 0 : tmul / num;
        else
            num = tmul;
    }

    return nums;
}
```

This algorithm efficiently calculates the desired product of all elements in the input vector while handling the presence of zeros appropriately. The time complexity of this algorithm is O(N), where N is the number of elements in the input vector `nums`, as it processes the vector twice.
