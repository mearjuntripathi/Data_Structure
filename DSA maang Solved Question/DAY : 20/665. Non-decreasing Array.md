# [665. Non-decreasing Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/non-decreasing-array/)

Given an array `nums` with `n` integers, your task is to check if it could become non-decreasing by modifying at most one element.

We define an array is non-decreasing if `nums[i] <= nums[i + 1]` holds for every `i` **(0-based)** such that `(0 <= i <= n - 2)`.

 


**Example 1:**

>**Input:** nums = [4,2,3]<br>
**Output:** true<br>
**Explanation:** You could modify the first 4 to 1 to get a non-decreasing array.

**Example 2:**

>**Input:** nums = [4,2,1]<br>
**Output:** false<br>
**Explanation:** You cannot get a non-decreasing array by modifying at most one element.
 

**Constraints:**

- `n == nums.length`
- `1 <= n <= 104`
- `-105 <= nums[i] <= 105`

# Solution

The approach used in the given code is to iterate over the array and check if any two consecutive elements are out of order. If they are, then we check the following conditions:

1. If the element before the current element is greater than the current element and the element after the current element is less than the element before the current element, then we have three elements that are out of order, and we return `false`.
2. If the number of times we have encountered an out-of-order element is greater than one, then we return `false`.

Otherwise, we return `true`. This code works because if there are more than two elements that are out of order, then we cannot make the array increasing by changing the order of at most one element.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool checkPossibility(vector<int>& nums) {
        int count = 0;

        for(int i = 1 ;i < nums.size() ; i ++){
            if(nums[i] >= nums[i-1])
                continue;
            else{
                count++;
                if(((i-2 >= 0 && nums[i-2] > nums[i]) && 
                    (i+1 < nums.size() && nums[i+1] < nums[i-1])) || 
                    count > 1)

                    return false;
            }
        }
       
        return count <= 1; 
    }
};
```

Here is a more detailed explanation of the algorithm:

1. Initialize a counter variable `count` to zero.
2. Iterate over the array from index 1 to the end.
    * If the current element is greater than or equal to the previous element, then continue.
    * Otherwise, increment the counter variable `count`.
    * If the following conditions are met, then return `false`:
        * The element before the current element is greater than the current element and the element after the current element is less than the element before the current element.
        * The counter variable `count` is greater than one.
3. Return `true`.

Here is a step-by-step example of how the algorithm works:


Input: nums = [4, 2, 3, 1]

1. count = 0
2. i = 1
    * nums[i] < nums[i - 1]
    * count = 1
    * Since the element before the current element is greater than the current element and the element after the current element is less than the element before the current element, we return `false`.


Therefore, the output of the algorithm is `false`.

## Conclusion

The given code provides a simple and efficient way to check if an array can be made increasing by changing the order of at most one element.
