# [16. 3Sum Closest](https://leetcode.com/problems/3sum-closest/)

Given an integer array `nums` of length n and an integer target, find three integers in `nums` such that the sum is closest to `target`.

Return the sum of the three integers.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution.

 


**Example 1:**

>**Input:** nums = [-1,2,1,-4], target = 1<br>
**Output:** 2<br>
**Explanation:** The sum that is closest to the target is 2. (-1 + 2 + 1 = 2).

**Example 2:**

>**Input:** nums = [0,0,0], target = 1<br>
**Output:** 0<br>
**Explanation:** The sum that is closest to the target is 0. (0 + 0 + 0 = 0).
 

**Constraints:**

- `3 <= nums.length <= 500`
- `-1000 <= nums[i] <= 1000`
- `-104 <= target <= 104`

# Solution

The approach of the code i provided is to use a two-pointer technique to find the three elements in the array whose sum is closest to the target value.

The algorithm is as follows:

1. Sort the input array in ascending order.
2. Initialize three pointers, `i`, `j`, and `k`, to point to the beginning, middle, and end of the array, respectively.
3. Initialize a variable `closest` to store the sum of the three elements that is closest to the target value.
4. While `j` is less than `k`:
    * Calculate the sum of the three elements `nums[i]`, `nums[j]`, and `nums[k]`.
    * If the sum is equal to the target value, return the target value.
    * If the sum is greater than the target value, decrement `k`.
    * Otherwise, increment `j`.
5. Update `closest` to be the sum of the three elements that is closest to the target value.
6. Return `closest`.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int threeSumClosest(vector<int>& nums, int target) {        
        int l = nums.size();

        if(l == 3)
            return nums[0]+nums[1]+nums[2];
        int close = 0;
        sort(nums.begin(), nums.end());
        for(int i = 0 ; i < l-2 ; i++){
            int j = i+1;
            int k = l-1;
            if(i==0)
                close = nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k];

            while(j<k){
                int sum = nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k];
                
                close = (abs(target-close) > abs(target-sum)) ? sum : close;

                if(target == sum) return target;

                (target > sum) ?  j++ : k--;
            }
        }
        return close;
    }
};
```

Here is a step-by-step example of how the algorithm works:

```
Input: nums = [-1, 2, 1, -4], target = 1

1. Sort the array: nums = [-4, -1, 1, 2]
2. Initialize the pointers: i = 0, j = 1, k = 3
3. Initialize closest: closest = -4 - 1 + 2 = -3
4. While j < k:
    * Calculate the sum: sum = -4 - 1 + 2 = -3
    * Since sum is equal to the target value, return the target value.
5. Return closest: closest = -3

Output: 1
```

## Pros and Cons of this Approach

The following are the pros and cons of the approach used in the code you provided:

**Pros:**

* Efficient for large arrays.
* Requires O(1) space.

**Cons:**

* Requires the input array to be sorted.
* Does not guarantee to find the optimal solution.

## Conclusion

The approach used in the code you provided is an efficient way to find the three elements in the array whose sum is closest to the target value. It is particularly useful for large arrays. However, it requires the input array to be sorted and does not guarantee to find the optimal solution.
