# [904. Fruit Into Baskets](https://leetcode.com/problems/fruit-into-baskets/)

You are visiting a farm that has a single row of fruit trees arranged from left to right. The trees are represented by an integer array `fruits` where `fruits[i]` is the type of fruit the `ith` tree produces.

You want to collect as much fruit as possible. However, the owner has some strict rules that you must follow:

- You only have two baskets, and each basket can only hold a single type of fruit. There is no limit on the amount of fruit each basket can hold.
- Starting from any tree of your choice, you must pick exactly one fruit from every tree (including the start tree) while moving to the right. The picked fruits must fit in one of your baskets.
- Once you reach a tree with fruit that cannot fit in your baskets, you must stop.

Given the integer array `fruits`, return the maximum number of fruits you can pick.

**Example 1:**

>**Input:** fruits = [1,2,1]<br>
**Output:** 3<br>
**Explanation:** We can pick from all 3 trees.

**Example 2:**

>**Input:** fruits = [0,1,2,2]<br>
**Output:** 3<br>
**Explanation:** We can pick from trees [1,2,2].
If we had started at the first tree, we would only pick from trees [0,1].

**Example 3:**

>**Input:** fruits = [1,2,3,2,2]<br>
**Output:** 4<br>
**Explanation:** We can pick from trees [2,3,2,2].
If we had started at the first tree, we would only pick from trees [1,2].
 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= fruits.length <= 1e5`
- `0 <= fruits[i] < fruits.length`

# Solutionn

This problem could be solved by a sliding window approach. We maintain a map to store the number of fruits of each kind in the current window. We also maintain two pointers, `pos` and `i`. The pointer `pos` points to the start of the current window, and the pointer `i` scans the array from left to right.

At each step, we check if the current fruit (i.e., `fruits[i]`) is already in the map. If it is, we simply increment the count of that fruit. Otherwise, we check if the size of the map is equal to 2. If it is, we need to remove one fruit from the window. We do this by decrementing the count of the fruit at the position `pos`. If the count of that fruit becomes 0, we remove it from the map and increment the pointer `pos`.

After removing one fruit from the window, we add the current fruit to the window. We also increment the count of the current fruit in the map. We then update the maximum fruit count if necessary.

The following is a C++ implementation of the above algorithm:

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int totalFruit(vector<int>& fruits) {
        int maxfruit = 0;
        int basket = 0;
        int fruit = 0;
        int pos = 0;
        
        unordered_map<int,int> mp;

        for(int i = 0 ; i < fruits.size() ; i++){
            if(mp[fruits[i]] == 0 && basket == 2){
                while(pos < i){
                    mp[fruits[pos]]--;
                    fruit--;
                    if(mp[fruits[pos++]] == 0)
                        break;
                }
                basket--;
            }
            if(mp[fruits[i]] == 0) basket++;

            mp[fruits[i]]++;
            fruit++;
            maxfruit = max(maxfruit, fruit);
        }
        return maxfruit;
    }
};
```

This algorithm has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the input array. It also has a space complexity of O(1), since we only need to maintain a map of constant size.
