# [152. Maximum Product Subarray](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-product-subarray/)

Given an integer array `nums`, find a subarray that has the largest product, and return the product.

The test cases are generated so that the answer will fit in a 32-bit integer.

**Example 1:**

>**Input:** nums = [2,3,-2,4]<br>
**Output:** 6<br>
**Explanation:** [2,3] has the largest product 6.

**Example 2:**

>**Input:** nums = [-2,0,-1]<br>
**Output:** 0<br>
**Explanation:** The result cannot be 2, because [-2,-1] is not a subarray.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 2 * 10^4`
- `-10 <= nums[i] <= 10`
- The product of any prefix or suffix of nums is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.

# Solution
The approach for this solution is to maintain two variables, `leftProd` and `rightProd`, which represent the product of the subarray ending at the current index from the left and right, respectively. We also maintain a variable `maxProd`, which represents the maximum product of any subarray so far.

We iterate over the array, and at each index, we update `leftProd` and `rightProd` by multiplying them by the current element. We also update `maxProd` by taking the maximum of its current value, `leftProd`, and `rightProd`.

If `leftProd` or `rightProd` becomes 0, we reset it to 1. This is because a product of 0 and any other number will be 0, so we don't want to carry over a 0 product from one iteration to the next.

After the loop has finished iterating, `maxProd` will contain the maximum product of any subarray in the array.

Here is an algorithm for the solution in C++:

```c++
int maxProduct(vector<int>& nums) {
  int maxProd = nums[0];
  int leftProd = 1;
  int rightProd = 1;

  int n = nums.size()-1;

  for (int i = 0; i <= n; i++) {
    leftProd *= nums[i];
    rightProd *= nums[n - i];
    maxProd = max(maxProd, max(leftProd, rightProd));
    if (leftProd == 0) leftProd = 1;
    if (rightProd == 0) rightProd = 1;
  }

  return maxProd;
}
```

Example usage:

```c++
vector<int> nums = {2, 3, -2, 4};

Solution solution;
int maxProd = solution.maxProduct(nums);

cout << maxProd << endl; // Output: 6
```
