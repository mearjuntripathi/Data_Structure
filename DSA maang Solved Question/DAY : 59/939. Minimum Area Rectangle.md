# [939. Minimum Area Rectangle](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-area-rectangle/)

You are given an array of points in the X-Y plane `points` where `points[i] = [xi, yi]`.

Return the minimum area of a rectangle formed from these points, with sides parallel to the X and Y axes. If there is not any such rectangle, return `0`.

**Example 1:**

>**Input:** points = [[1,1],[1,3],[3,1],[3,3],[4,1],[4,3]]<br>
**Output:** 2
 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= points.length <= 500`
- `points[i].length == 2`
- `0 <= xi, yi <= 4 * 1e4`
- All the given points are unique.

# Solution

The approach is to find the minimum area rectangle that can be formed by the given points. The algorithm is as follows:
1. Sort the points by their X-coordinate.
2. For each point, find the other point which forms a diagonal with it.
3. If the other point exists, check if the mirror point of the current point exists.
4. If the mirror point exists, calculate the area of the rectangle and update the minimum area.
5. Repeat steps 2-4 for all the points.

Here is the algorithm in C++:

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int minAreaRect(vector<vector<int>>& points) {
        using pi = pair<int,int>;
        vector<pi> pointList;
        set<pi> pointSet;
        for (auto& p: points) {
            pointList.push_back({p[0],p[1]});
            pointSet.insert({p[0],p[1]});
        }
        sort(pointList.begin(),pointList.end());

        int totalPoints = pointList.size();
        int result = INT_MAX;
        for (int i = 0; i < totalPoints-3; i++) {
            int x1 = pointList[i].first;
            int y1 = pointList[i].second;
            for (int j = i+1; j < totalPoints;) {
                int x2 = pointList[j].first;
                int y2 = pointList[j].second;

                // found out diagnoal point opposite to left most base point
                if ((x1 != x2) && (y1 != y2) && (x1 < x2) && (y1 < y2)) {
                    pi leftPoint = make_pair(x1,y2);
                    pi rightPoint = make_pair(x2,y1);
                    // if mirror point exists which means it can form a rectangle
                    if (pointSet.count(leftPoint) && pointSet.count(rightPoint)) {
                        // calcuate the area  then and update the minmumm
                        int curArea = (x2-x1)*(y2-y1);
                        result = min(result,curArea);
                        j++;
                        // skip all the points for the given x as minimumm area with same
                        // and least Y is already computed.
                        while(j < totalPoints && (pointList[j].first == x2))
                            j++;
                        continue;
                    }
                }
                j++;
            }
        }
        return result == INT_MAX ? 0 : result;

    }
};
```

This algorithm is efficient because it only needs to iterate over the points once. It also uses a set to keep track of the points that have already been visited, which prevents the algorithm from repeating itself.
