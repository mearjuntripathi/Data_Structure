# [322. Coin Change](https://leetcode.com/problems/coin-change/)

You are given an integer array `coins` representing coins of different denominations and an integer `amount` representing a total amount of money.

Return the fewest number of coins that you need to make up that amount. If that amount of money cannot be made up by any combination of the coins, return `-1`.

You may assume that you have an infinite number of each kind of coin.

**Example 1:**

>**Input:** coins = [1,2,5], amount = 11<br>
**Output:** 3<br>
**Explanation:** 11 = 5 + 5 + 1

**Example 2:**

>**Input:** coins = [2], amount = 3<br>
**Output:** -1

**Example 3:**

>**Input:** coins = [1], amount = 0<br>
**Output:** 0 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= coins.length <= 12`
- `1 <= coins[i] <= 2^31 - 1`
- `0 <= amount <= 1e4`

# Solution

The approach and algorithm for the `coinChange()` solution in C++ is as follows:

**Approach:**

* Use dynamic programming to solve the problem.
* Build a table `dp` of size `amount + 1`, where `amount` is the target amount.
* Initialize `dp[0]` to 0, since there is only one way to make the sum 0, which is by not selecting any coin.
* For each amount `i` from 1 to `amount`:
    * Iterate over all coins in the `coins` array.
    * If the current coin `coin` is less than or equal to the current amount `i` and the subproblem `dp[i - coin]` is not equal to `INT_MAX`, then:
        * Update `dp[i]` to the minimum of its current value and `1 + dp[i - coin]`.
* Return `dp[amount]`.

**Algorithm:**

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int coinChange(vector<int>& coins, int amount) {
        vector<int> dp(amount+1, INT_MAX);
        dp[0] = 0;

        for(int i = 1 ; i <= amount ; i++)
            for(auto &coin : coins)
                if(coin <= i && dp[i-coin] != INT_MAX)
                    dp[i] = min(dp[i], 1+dp[i-coin]);
        
        return dp[amount] == INT_MAX ? -1 : dp[amount];   
    }
};
```

**Example:**

```c++
int main() {
    vector<int> coins = {1, 5, 10};
    int amount = 12;

    Solution solution;
    int minCoins = solution.coinChange(coins, amount);

    cout << "The minimum number of coins required to make the sum " << amount << " is: " << minCoins << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

Output:

```
The minimum number of coins required to make the sum 12 is: 3
```
