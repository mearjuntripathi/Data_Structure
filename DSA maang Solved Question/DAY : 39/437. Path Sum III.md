# [437. Path Sum III](https://leetcode.com/problems/path-sum-iii/)

Given the `root` of a binary tree and an integer `targetSum`, return the number of paths where the sum of the values along the path equals `targetSum`.

The path does not need to start or end at the root or a leaf, but it must go downwards (i.e., traveling only from parent nodes to child nodes).

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/04/09/pathsum3-1-tree.jpg)

>**Input:** root = [10,5,-3,3,2,null,11,3,-2,null,1], targetSum = 8<br>
**Output:** 3<br>
**Explanation:** The paths that sum to 8 are shown.

**Example 2:**

>**Input:** root = [5,4,8,11,null,13,4,7,2,null,null,5,1], targetSum = 22<br>
**Output:** 3
 

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 1000]`.
- `-1e9 <= Node.val <= 1e9`
- `-1000 <= targetSum <= 1000`

# Solution

This C++ solution to the Path Sum problem uses two approaches:

**Brute Force Approach:**

This approach uses O(n) time and O(1) space.

1. Recursively traverse the tree, starting at the root node.
2. At each node, check if the sum of the path from the root node to the current node is equal to the target sum. If it is, increment the number of paths.
3. Recursively traverse the left and right subtrees of the current node.
4. Return the number of paths.

**Algorithm:**

```c++
class Solution {
    int pathSum(TreeNode* root, long long targetSum, int &paths){
        if(!root) 
            return paths;
        targetSum -= root->val;
        if(targetSum == 0)
            paths++;
        pathSum(root->left, targetSum, paths);
        pathSum(root->right, targetSum, paths);
        return paths;
    }
public:
    int paths = 0;
    int pathSum(TreeNode* root, int targetSum) {
        // brute force approach
        if(root){
            pathSum(root, targetSum, paths);
            pathSum(root->left, targetSum);
            pathSum(root->right, targetSum);
        }
        return paths;

        // Optimal Approach
        if(root){
            unordered_map<long long,int> mp;
            mp[0] = 1;
            pathSum(root,targetSum,mp,0);
            mp.clear();
        }
        return paths;
    }
};
```

**Optimal Approach:**

This approach uses O(n) time and O(n) space.

1. Use a hash map to store the cumulative sums of all the paths from the root node to every node in the tree.
2. Recursively traverse the tree, starting at the root node.
3. At each node, check if the cumulative sum of the path from the root node to the
current node minus the target sum is present in the hash map. If it is, increment
the number of paths.
4. Update the cumulative sum of the path from the root node to the current node in
the hash map.
5. Recursively traverse the left and right subtrees of the current node.
6. Remove the cumulative sum of the path from the root node to the current node from
the hash map.
7. Return the number of paths.

**Algorithm:**

```c++
class Solution {
    void pathSum(TreeNode* root, int targetSum, unordered_map<long long,int> &mp, long long sum){
        if(!root) return;

        sum += root->val;

        paths += mp[sum-targetSum];
        mp[sum]++;
        pathSum(root->left, targetSum, mp, sum);
        pathSum(root->right, targetSum, mp, sum);
        mp[sum]--;
    }
public:
    int pathSum(TreeNode* root, int targetSum) {
        int paths = 0;
        // Optimal Approach
        if(root){
            unordered_map<long long,int> mp;
            mp[0] = 1;
            pathSum(root,targetSum,mp,0);
            mp.clear();
        }
        return paths;
    }
};
```

The optimal approach is more efficient than the brute force approach because it only needs to traverse the tree once.
