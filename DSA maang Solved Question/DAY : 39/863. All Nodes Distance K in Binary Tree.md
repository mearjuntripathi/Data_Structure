# [863. All Nodes Distance K in Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/all-nodes-distance-k-in-binary-tree/)

Given the `root` of a binary tree, the value of a `target` node target, and an integer `k`, return an array of the values of all nodes that have a distance k from the target node.

You can return the answer in any order.


**Example 1:**

>**Input:** root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], target = 5, k = 2<br>
**Output:** [7,4,1]<br>
**Explanation:** The nodes that are a distance 2 from the target node (with value 5) have values 7, 4, and 1.

**Example 2:**

>**Input:** root = [1], target = 1, k = 3<br>
**Output:** []
 

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 500]`.
- `0 <= Node.val <= 500`
- All the values Node.val are unique.
- `target` is the value of one of the nodes in the tree.
- `0 <= k <= 1000`

# Solution
The above C++ solution to the Distance K problem uses the following approach:

1. Create a hash map `c2p` that maps a child node's value to its parent node.
2. Initialize a queue `que` and add the target node to it.
3. Initialize a set `covered` to keep track of the nodes that have already been visited.
4. While the queue is not empty and `k` is greater than or equal to zero:
    * Get the size of the queue.
    * For each node in the queue:
        * If the node's left child is not `NULL` and has not been visited, add it to the queue.
        * If the node's right child is not `NULL` and has not been visited, add it to the queue.
        * If the node's parent node is not `NULL` and has not been visited, add it to the queue.
    * Decrement `k`.
5. Create a vector `values` to store the values of the nodes that are `k` distance away from the target node.
6. While the queue is not empty:
    * Add the value of the front node to the vector `values`.
    * Pop the front node from the queue.
7. Return the vector `values`.

Here is the algorithm for the above C++ solution:

```c++
class Solution {
    void childToParent(TreeNode* root, unordered_map<int, TreeNode*> &c2p){
        // If left is null so didn't insert value of it
        if(root->left){ 
            c2p[root->left->val] = root;
            childToParent(root->left,c2p);
        }
        // If right is null so didn't insert value of it
        if(root->right){
            c2p[root->right->val] = root;
            childToParent(root->right,c2p);
        }
    }
public:
    vector<int> distanceK(TreeNode* root, TreeNode* target, int k) {
        // Create a hash map `c2p` that maps a child node's value to its parent node.
        unordered_map<int, TreeNode*> c2p;
        c2p[root->val] = NULL;
        childToParent(root, c2p);

        // Initialize a queue `que` and add the target node to it.
        queue<TreeNode*> que;
        que.push(target);

        // Initialize a set `covered` to keep track of the nodes that have already been visited.
        unordered_set<int> covered;

        // While the queue is not empty and `k` is greater than or equal to zero:
        while (k-- && !que.empty()) {
          // Get the size of the queue.
            int length = que.size();

            // For each node in the queue:
            for (int i = 0; i < length; i++) {
                // Get the front node from the queue.
                TreeNode* dummy = que.front();
                que.pop();
        
                // Get the parent node of the front node.
                TreeNode* parent = c2p[dummy->val];
        
                // Add the front node to the set `covered`.
                covered.insert(dummy->val);
        
                // If the front node's left child is not `NULL` and has not been visited, add it to the queue.
                if (dummy->left && !covered.count(dummy->left->val)) que.push(dummy->left);
        
                // If the front node's right child is not `NULL` and has not been visited, add it to the queue.
                if (dummy->right && !covered.count(dummy->right->val)) que.push(dummy->right);
        
                // If the front node's parent node is not `NULL` and has not been visited, add it to the queue.
                if (c2p[dummy->val] && !covered.count(c2p[dummy->val]->val)) que.push(c2p[dummy->val]);
            }
        }

        // Create a vector `values` to store the values of the nodes that are `k` distance away from the target node.
        vector<int> values;

        // While the queue is not empty:
        while (!que.empty()) {
          // Add the value of the front node to the vector `values`.
          values.push_back(que.front()->val);

          // Pop the front node from the queue.
          que.pop();
        }

        // Return the vector `values`.
        return values;
    }
};
```

This C++ solution to the Distance K problem is time-efficient and space-efficient. It uses O(n) time to create the hash map `c2p` and O(n) time to perform the breadth-first search. It also uses O(n) space to store the queue `que` and the set `covered`.
