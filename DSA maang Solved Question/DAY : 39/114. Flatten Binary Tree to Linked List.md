# [114. Flatten Binary Tree to Linked List](https://leetcode.com/problems/flatten-binary-tree-to-linked-list/)

Given the `root` of a binary tree, flatten the tree into a "linked list":

- The "linked list" should use the same `TreeNode` class where the `right` child pointer points to the next node in the list and the `left` child pointer is always null.
- The "linked list" should be in the same order as a [pre-order traversal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_traversal#Pre-order,_NLR) of the binary tree.

**Example 1:**

>**Input:** root = [1,2,5,3,4,null,6]<br>
**Output:** [1,null,2,null,3,null,4,null,5,null,6]

**Example 2:**

>**Input:** root = []<br>
**Output:** []

**Example 3:**

>**Input:** root = [0]<br>
**Output:** [0]
 

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 2000]`.
- `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`
 

**Follow up:** Can you flatten the tree in-place (with `O(1)` extra space)?

# Solution

The approach of this solution is to flatten the binary tree in-place by traversing it in a post-order fashion. This means that we recursively process the left and right subtrees of each node before processing the node itself.

The algorithm works as follows:

1. If the current node has a left subtree:
    * Find the predecessor of the current node. This is the rightmost node in the left subtree of the current node.
    * Set the predecessor's right pointer to the current node's right subtree.
    * Set the current node's right pointer to the current node's left subtree.
    * Set the current node's left pointer to NULL.
2. Move to the current node's right subtree.
3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 until the current node is NULL.

Here is a pseudocode implementation of the algorithm in C++:

```c++
void flatten(TreeNode* root) {
  if (!root) {
    return;
  }

  // Flatten the left subtree.
  flatten(root->left);

  // Flatten the right subtree.
  flatten(root->right);

  // If the current node has a left subtree, connect it to the right subtree.
  if (root->left) {
    TreeNode* predecessor = root->left;
    while (predecessor->right) {
      predecessor = predecessor->right;
    }
    predecessor->right = root->right;
    root->right = root->left;
    root->left = NULL;
  }
}
```

This algorithm is efficient because it only traverses the tree once. It also uses no additional space, since it modifies the tree in-place.
