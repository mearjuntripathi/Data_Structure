# [113. Path Sum II](https://leetcode.com/problems/path-sum-ii/)

Given the `root` of a binary tree and an integer `targetSum`, return all **root-to-leaf** paths where the sum of the node values in the path equals `targetSum`. Each path should be returned as a list of the node **values**, not node references.

A **root-to-leaf** path is a path starting from the root and ending at any **leaf** node. A leaf is a node with no children.

 


**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/01/18/pathsumii1.jpg)

>**Input:** root = [5,4,8,11,null,13,4,7,2,null,null,5,1], targetSum = 22<br>
**Output:** [[5,4,11,2],[5,8,4,5]]<br>
**Explanation:** There are two paths whose sum equals targetSum:<br>
5 + 4 + 11 + 2 = 22<br>
5 + 8 + 4 + 5 = 22

**Example 2:**


>**Input:** root = [1,2,3], targetSum = 5<br>
**Output:** []

**Example 3:**

>**Input:** root = [1,2], targetSum = 0<br>
**Output:** []
 

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 5000]`.
- `-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000`
- `-1000 <= targetSum <= 1000`

# Solution
This solution to the Path Sum problem in C++ uses a recursive approach.

The algorithm is as follows:

1. Recursively traverse the tree, starting at the root node.
2. At each node, subtract the node's value from the target sum.
3. If the target sum is equal to zero and the node is a leaf node, add the current path to the list of paths.
4. Otherwise, continue traversing the tree recursively, passing down the updated target sum and the current path.

Here is a C++ implementation of the algorithm:

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> pathSum(TreeNode* root, int targetSum) {
        vector<vector<int>> paths;
        vector<int> path;
        pathSumHelper(root, targetSum, path, paths);
        return paths;
    }

private:
    void pathSumHelper(TreeNode* root, int targetSum, vector<int>& path, vector<vector<int>>& paths) {
        if (!root) {
            return;
        }

        targetSum -= root->val;
        path.push_back(root->val);
        if (targetSum == 0 && !root->left && !root->right) {
            paths.push_back(path);
        }

        pathSumHelper(root->left, targetSum, path, paths);
        pathSumHelper(root->right, targetSum, path, paths);
        path.pop_back();
    }
};
```
This algorithm is time-efficient and space-efficient. It uses O(n) time to traverse the tree and O(h) space to store the current path, where h is the height of the tree.
