# [202. Happy Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/happy-number/)

Write an algorithm to determine if a number n is happy.

A happy number is a number defined by the following process:

- Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits.
- Repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1.
- Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy.
Return true if n is a happy number, and false if not.

 

**Example 1:**

> **Input:** n = 19<br>
**Output:** true<br>
**Explanation:**<br>
12 + 92 = 82<br>
82 + 22 = 68<br>
62 + 82 = 100<br>
12 + 02 + 02 = 1

**Example 2:**

> **Input:** n = 2<br>
**Output:** false
 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= n <= 231 - 1`

# Solution
The approach of the code is to use a hash set to track the numbers that have already been visited. The code starts by calculating the sum of the squares of the digits of n. If the result is 1, then n is a happy number and the code returns true. Otherwise, the code adds the result to the hash set and repeats the process.

The algorithm of the code is as follows:

1. Initialize a hash set `st` to store the numbers that have already been visited.
2. Set `n` to the input number.
3. While `n` is not equal to 1:
    * Calculate the sum of the squares of the digits of `n`.
    * If the result is in `st`, then return false.
    * Add the result to `st`.
    * Set `n` to the result.
4. Return true.

Here is a more detailed explanation of the algorithm:

```
inline int check(int num){
    int result = 0;
    while(num){
        result += pow(num%10,2);
        num /= 10;
    }
    return result;
}

public:
    bool isHappy(int n) {
        unordered_set<int> st;
        while(n != 1){
            cout<<n<< ' ';
            if(st.count(n))
                return false;
            st.insert(n);
            n = check(n);
        }
        st.clear();
        return true;        
    }
};
```

The `check()` function calculates the sum of the squares of the digits of a number. The `isHappy()` function takes a number as input and returns true if the number is happy, and false otherwise.

The `isHappy()` function works by iteratively calculating the sum of the squares of the digits of the input number. If the result is 1, then the number is happy and the function returns true. Otherwise, the function checks if the result is in the hash set. If it is, then the number is not happy and the function returns false. Otherwise, the function adds the result to the hash set and repeats the process.

Here is an example of how the `isHappy()` function would be used:

```
Solution solution;
bool isHappy = solution.isHappy(19);
```

The variable `isHappy` would then contain the value `true`, because the number 19 is a happy number.

Here is an example of how the code would work for the input number 9:

```
n = 9
while(n != 1):
    cout<<n<< ' '
    n = check(n)
```

The code would print the following **output:**

```
9 81
```

The code would then return false, because the number 81 is in the hash set, which means that the number 9 is not happy.
