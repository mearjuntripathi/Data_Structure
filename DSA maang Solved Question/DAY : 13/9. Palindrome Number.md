# [9. Palindrome Number]()

Given an integer `x`, return `true` if `x` is a 
<a title = "Palindrome
An integer is a palindrome when it reads the same forward and backward.

, and fa`lse otherwise.

 

**Example 1:**

> **Input:** x = 121<br>
**Output:** true<br>
**Explanation:** 121 reads as 121 from left to right and from right to left.

**Example 2:**

> **Input:** x = -121<br>
**Output:** false<br>
**Explanation:** From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.

**Example 3:**

> **Input:** x = 10<br>
**Output:** false<br>
**Explanation:** Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
 

**Constraints:**

- `-231 <= x <= 231 - 1`
 

**Follow up**: Could you solve it without converting the integer to a string?

# Solution

The approach of the code is to reverse the input number and compare it to the original number. If the two numbers are the same, then the input number is a palindrome. Otherwise, the input number is not a palindrome.

**The algorithm of the code is as follows:**

1. Check if the input number is negative. If it is, then return false because negative numbers cannot be palindromes.
2. Take the absolute value of the input number.
3. Create a variable `comp` to store the reversed number.
4. Iterate over the input number:
    * Multiply `comp` by 10.
    * Add the remainder of the input number divided by 10 to `comp`.
    * Divide the input number by 10.
5. Compare `comp` to the input number. If they are the same, then return true. Otherwise, return false.

**Here is a more detailed explanation of the algorithm:**

```cpp
bool isPalindrome(int x) {
        if(x < 0)
            return false;
        int y = abs(x);

        long comp = 0;
        while(x){
            comp *= 10;
            comp += x%10;
            x /= 10;
        }
        return comp == y;
    }
```

The code first checks if the input number is negative. If it is, then the code returns false because negative numbers cannot be palindromes.

The code then takes the absolute value of the input number. This is necessary because the code needs to compare the reversed number to the original number, and the reversed number will always be positive.

The code then creates a variable `comp` to store the reversed number. The code then iterates over the input number, multiplying `comp` by 10 and adding the remainder of the input number divided by 10 to `comp` at each step. This effectively reverses the input number.

Once the code has finished iterating over the input number, it compares `comp` to the input number. If they are the same, then the code returns true because the input number is a palindrome. Otherwise, the code returns false because the input number is not a palindrome.

Here is an example of how the `isPalindrome()` function would be used:

```cpp
Solution solution;
bool isPalindrome = solution.isPalindrome(121);
```

The variable `isPalindrome` would then contain the value `true`, because the number 121 is a palindrome.
