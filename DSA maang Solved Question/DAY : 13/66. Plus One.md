# [66. Plus One](https://leetcode.com/problems/plus-one/)

You are given a large integer represented as an integer array `digits`, where each `digits[i]` is the `i`<sup>th</sup> digit of the integer. The digits are ordered from most significant to least significant in left-to-right order. The large integer does not contain any leading `0`'s.

Increment the large integer by one and return the resulting array of digits.

 

**Example 1:**

> **Input:** digits = [1,2,3]<br>
**Output:** [1,2,4]<br>
**Explanation:** The array represents the integer 123.<br>
Incrementing by one gives 123 + 1 = 124.<br>
Thus, the result should be [1,2,4].

**Example 2:**

> **Input:** digits = [4,3,2,1]<br>
**Output:** [4,3,2,2]<br>
**Explanation:** The array represents the integer 4321.<br>
Incrementing by one gives 4321 + 1 = 4322.<br>
Thus, the result should be [4,3,2,2].

**Example 3:**

> **Input:** digits = [9]<br>
**Output:** [1,0]<br>
**Explanation:** The array represents the integer 9.<br>
Incrementing by one gives 9 + 1 = 10.<br>
Thus, the result should be [1,0].
 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= digits.length <= 100`
- `0 <= digits[i] <= 9`
- digits does not contain any leading `0`'s.

# Solution

The approach of the code is to iterate over the digits of the input number from the least significant digit to the most significant digit. At each step, the code adds the carry value to the current digit and updates the carry value. If the sum of the current digit and carry value is greater than 9, then the code sets the current digit to 0 and increments the carry value. If the sum of the current digit and carry value is less than or equal to 9, then the code updates the current digit to the sum and sets the carry value to 0.

**The algorithm of the code is as follows:**

1. Initialize a carry variable to 1.
2. Iterate over the digits of the input number from the least significant digit to the most significant digit:
    * Add the carry value to the current digit.
    * If the sum of the current digit and carry value is greater than 9, then set the current digit to 0 and increment the carry value.
    * If the sum of the current digit and carry value is less than or equal to 9, then update the current digit to the sum and set the carry value to 0.
3. If the carry value is still 1 after iterating over all of the digits, then add a new digit 1 to the beginning of the number.
4. Return the number.

**Here is a more detailed explanation of the algorithm:**

```cpp
vector<int> plusOne(vector<int>& digits) {
    int carry = 1;
    for(int i = digits.size()-1 ; i >= 0 ; i--){
        if(digits[i]+carry > 9){
            digits[i] = 0;
        }else{
            digits[i] += carry;
            carry = 0;
            return digits;
        }
    }
    digits.insert(digits.begin(),carry);
    return digits;
}
```

The code first initializes a carry variable to 1. This is because the code is adding 1 to the input number.

Next, the code iterates over the digits of the input number from the least significant digit to the most significant digit. At each step, the code adds the carry value to the current digit and updates the carry value. If the sum of the current digit and carry value is greater than 9, then the code sets the current digit to 0 and increments the carry value. If the sum of the current digit and carry value is less than or equal to 9, then the code updates the current digit to the sum and sets the carry value to 0.

After iterating over all of the digits, the code checks if the carry value is still 1. If it is, then the code adds a new digit 1 to the beginning of the number. This is because the carry value represents the overflow from the most significant digit.

Finally, the code returns the number.

Here is an example of how the `plusOne()` function would be used:

```cpp
vector<int> digits = {1, 2, 3};
vector<int> new_digits = plusOne(digits);
```

The variable `new_digits` would then contain the number 124, which is the result of adding 1 to the number 123.
