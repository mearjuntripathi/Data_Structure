# [31. Next Permutation](https://leetcode.com/problems/next-permutation/)

A permutation of an array of integers is an arrangement of its members into a sequence or linear order.

- For example, for `arr = [1,2,3]`, the following are all the permutations of arr: `[1,2,3], [1,3,2], [2, 1, 3], [2, 3, 1], [3,1,2], [3,2,1]`.

The next permutation of an array of integers is the next lexicographically greater permutation of its integer. More formally, if all the permutations of the array are sorted in one container according to their lexicographical order, then the next permutation of that array is the permutation that follows it in the sorted container. If such arrangement is not possible, the array must be rearranged as the lowest possible order (i.e., sorted in ascending order).

- For example, the next permutation of `arr = [1,2,3]` is `[1,3,2]`.
- Similarly, the next permutation of `arr = [2,3,1]` is `[3,1,2]`.
- While the next permutation of `arr = [3,2,1]` is `[1,2,3]` because `[3,2,1]` does not have a lexicographical larger rearrangement.

Given an array of integers `nums`, find the next permutation of nums.

The replacement must be in place and use only constant extra memory.

**Example 1:**

>**Input:** nums = [1,2,3]<br>
**Output:** [1,3,2]

**Example 2:**

>**Input:** nums = [3,2,1]<br>
**Output:** [1,2,3]

**Example 3:**

>**Input:** nums = [1,1,5]<br>
**Output:** [1,5,1]
 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 100`
- `0 <= nums[i] <= 100`

# Solution
Sure, here is an algorithm, approach, and code in C++ for finding the next permutation of a given array of integers:

**Algorithm**

The algorithm for finding the next permutation of a given array of integers is as follows:

1. Find the largest index `i` such that `nums[i] < nums[i + 1]`. If no such index exists, then the array is already in descending order, and the next permutation cannot be computed.
2. Calculate the largest index `j` such that `nums[j] > nums[i]`. Swap `nums[i]` and `nums[j]`.
3. Reverse the order of the elements from `nums[i + 1]` to the end of the array.

**Approach**

The approach for finding the next permutation of a given array of integers is to divide the array into two parts: the prefix and the suffix. The prefix is the part of the array that is in descending order, and the suffix is the part of the array that is in non-decreasing order. The algorithm finds the largest index `i` in the prefix and the largest index `j` in the suffix such that `nums[i] < nums[j]`. Then, the algorithm swaps `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` and reverses the order of the elements in the suffix.

**Code**

Here is the code in C++ for finding the next permutation of a given array of integers:

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    void nextPermutation(vector<int>& nums) {
        if (nums.size() == 1) {
            return;
        }

        int idx = -1;

        for (int i = nums.size() - 2; i >= 0; i--) {
            if (nums[i] < nums[i + 1]) {
                idx = i;
                break;
            }
        }

        if (idx != -1) {
            for (int i = nums.size() - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
                if (nums[i] > nums[idx]) {
                    swap(nums[i], nums[idx]);
                    break;
                }
            }
        }

        reverse(nums, idx + 1, nums.size() - 1);
    }
};
```

This code first defines a helper function `reverse()` that reverses the order of the elements in a vector from `s` to `e`. Then, the `nextPermutation()` function first checks if the array is empty or has only one element. If so, the function returns. Otherwise, the function finds the largest index `i` in the prefix and the largest index `j` in the suffix such that `nums[i] < nums[j]`. Then, the function swaps `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` and reverses the order of the elements in the suffix.

I hope this helps!
