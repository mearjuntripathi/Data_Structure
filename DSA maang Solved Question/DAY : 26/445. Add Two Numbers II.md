# [445. Add Two Numbers II](https://leetcode.com/problems/add-two-numbers-ii/)

You are given two **non-empty** linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The most significant digit comes first and each of their nodes contains a single digit. Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.

You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.


**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/04/09/sumii-linked-list.jpg)

>**Input:** l1 = [7,2,4,3], l2 = [5,6,4]<br>
**Output:** [7,8,0,7]

**Example 2:**

>**Input:** l1 = [2,4,3], l2 = [5,6,4]<br>
**Output:** [8,0,7]

**Example 3:**

>**Input:** l1 = [0], l2 = [0]<br>
**Output:** [0]
 

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in each linked list is in the range `[1, 100]`.
- `0 <= Node.val <= 9`
- It is guaranteed that the list represents a number that does not have leading zeros.
 

**Follow up:** Could you solve it without reversing the input lists?

# Solution

The approach used in this C++ solution to the add two numbers problem is to use two stacks to store the digits of the two numbers in reverse order. Then, the two stacks are popped one by one and the digits are added together. If the sum is greater than 9, a carry digit is set to 1 and the sum is modulo 10. The carry digit is then added to the next sum. This process is repeated until both stacks are empty and the carry digit is 0.

The algorithm is as follows:

1. Create two stacks to store the digits of the two numbers in reverse order.
2. Iterate over the two linked lists, adding each digit to the corresponding stack.
3. While both stacks are not empty:
    * Pop the top element from each stack and add them together.
    * If the sum is greater than 9, set a carry digit to 1 and the sum to modulo 10.
    * Add the carry digit to the next sum.
4. If there is a carry digit left over, create a new node with the value of the carry digit and add it to the beginning of the linked list.
5. Return the linked list.

Here is a C++ implementation of the above algorithm:

```cpp []
class Solution {
public:
    ListNode* addTwoNumbers(ListNode* l1, ListNode* l2) {
        stack<ListNode*>list1;
        stack<ListNode*>list2;

        ListNode *t1 = l1, *t2 = l2;

        while(t1 && t2){
            list1.push(t1);
            list2.push(t2);
            t1 = t1->next;
            t2 = t2->next;
        }
        while(t1){
            list1.push(t1);
            t1 = t1->next;
        }
        while(t2){
            list2.push(t2);
            t2 = t2->next;
        }

        int carry = 0;
        while(!list1.empty() && !list2.empty()){
            int sum = list1.top()->val + list2.top()->val + carry;
            if(sum > 9){
                list1.top()->val = sum % 10;
                carry = 1;
            }else{
                list1.top()->val = sum;
                carry = 0;
            }
            list1.pop();
            list2.pop();
        }
        if(!list1.empty()){
            while(!list1.empty() && carry){
                int sum = list1.top()->val + carry;
                if(sum > 9){
                    list1.top()->val = sum % 10;
                    carry = 1;
                }else{
                    list1.top()->val = sum;
                    carry = 0;
                }
                list1.pop();
            }
            if(carry){
                ListNode *newNode = new ListNode(carry,l1);
                l1 = newNode;
            }
            return l1;
        }
        if(!list2.empty()){
            list2.top()->next = l1;
            while(!list2.empty() && carry){
                int sum = list2.top()->val + carry;
                if(sum > 9){
                    list2.top()->val = sum % 10;
                    carry = 1;
                }else{
                    list2.top()->val = sum;
                    carry = 0;
                }
                list2.pop();
            }
            if(carry){
                ListNode *newNode = new ListNode(carry,l2);
                l2 = newNode;
            }
            return l2;
        }
        if(carry){
            ListNode *newNode = new ListNode(carry,l1);
            l1 = newNode;
        }
        return l1;
    }
};
```

This C++ solution is time-efficient and space-efficient. It uses O(n+m) time to iterate over the two linked lists and O(n+m) space to store the digits of the two numbers in the stacks.
