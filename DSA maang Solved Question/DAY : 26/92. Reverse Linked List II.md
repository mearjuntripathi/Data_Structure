# [92. Reverse Linked List II](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-linked-list-ii/)

Given the head of a singly linked list and two integers `left` and `right` where `left <= right`, reverse the nodes of the list from position `left` to position `right`, and return the reversed list.

 


**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/02/19/rev2ex2.jpg)

> **Input:** head = [1,2,3,4,5], left = 2, right = 4<br>
**Output:** [1,4,3,2,5]

**Example 2:**

> **Input:** head = [5], left = 1, right = 1<br>
**Output:** [5]
 

Constraints:

- The number of nodes in the list is `n`.
- `1 <= n <= 500`
- `-500 <= Node.val <= 500`
- `1 <= left <= right <= n`

# Solution

The approach used in this solution is to use three dummy nodes to reverse the linked list between the given two nodes.

**Algorithm:**

1. Create three dummy nodes: `l`, `c`, and `p`.
2. Initialize `l` to the node before the left node, `c` to the left node, and `p` to the next node after the left node.
3. Iterate over the linked list between the left node and the right node, reversing the links as follows:
    * Set `temp` to the next node after `p`.
    * Set the next node of `p` to `c`.
    * Set `c` to `p`.
    * Set `p` to `temp`.
4. Set the next node of `l` to `p`.
5. If `left` is equal to 1, then set the head of the linked list to `c`. Otherwise, set the next node of the node before the left node to `c`.
6. Return the head of the linked list.

**C++ implementation:**

```c++ []
class Solution {
public:
    ListNode* reverseBetween(ListNode* head, int left, int right) {
        // if right and left is same so there is no change
        if(left == right)
            return head;
        
        // get a lenght of between of list
        int len = right-left;
        ListNode *node = head; 
        
        // travel to one list before of left
        for(int  i = 0 ; i < left-2 ; i++)
            node = node->next;
        
        // create a dummy lists to reverse
        ListNode *l;
        ListNode *c;
        ListNode *p;
        // corner case when left is one so we start from beginning
        if(left == 1){
            l = node;
            c = l;
            p = l->next;
        }
        else{
            l = node->next;
            c = l;
            p = l->next;
        }
        // reversing concept using three dummy list
        for(int i = 0 ; i < len ; i++){
            ListNode *temp = p;
            p = p->next;
            temp->next = c;
            c = temp;
        }
        // indecation of well connectivity
        l->next = p;

        // corner case when left is one so we upade change at beginig
        if(left == 1)
            head = c;
        else node->next = c;

        // return updated list
        return head;
    }
};
```

This solution is time-efficient and space-efficient. It uses O(n) time to iterate over the linked list and O(1) space to store the three dummy nodes.
