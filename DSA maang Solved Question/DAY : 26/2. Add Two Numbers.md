# [2. Add Two Numbers](https://leetcode.com/problems/add-two-numbers/)

You are given two **non-empty** linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order, and each of their nodes contains a single digit. Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.

You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

 


**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/10/02/addtwonumber1.jpg)

>**Input:** l1 = [2,4,3], l2 = [5,6,4]<br>
**Output:** [7,0,8]<br>
**Explanation:** 342 + 465 = 807.

**Example 2:**

>**Input:** l1 = [0], l2 = [0]<br>
**Output:** [0]

**Example 3:**

>**Input:** l1 = [9,9,9,9,9,9,9], l2 = [9,9,9,9]<br>
**Output:** [8,9,9,9,0,0,0,1]
 

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in each linked list is in the range `[1, 100]`.
- `0 <= Node.val <= 9`
- It is guaranteed that the list represents a number that does not have leading zeros.

# Solution

This solution to the Add Two Numbers problem uses the following approach:

1. **Initialize two pointers, `t1` and `t2`, to the heads of the two linked lists.**
2. **Iterate over the two linked lists, starting with the heads of the lists.**
    * At each step, add the values of the nodes at `t1` and `t2`, plus any carry from the previous step.
    * If the sum is greater than or equal to 10, then:
        * Set the value of the node at `t1` to the remainder of the sum divided by 10.
        * Set the carry to 1.
    * Otherwise:
        * Set the value of the node at `t1` to the sum.
        * Set the carry to 0.
    * If the node at `t1` has no next node, then:
        * If the node at `t2` has no next node and the carry is 1, then create a new node with the value 1 and set the next node of `t1` to the new node.
        * Set the next node of `t1` to the next node of `t2`.
    * Otherwise:
        * Set `t1` to the next node of `t1`.
        * Set `t2` to the next node of `t2`.
3. **Return the head of the first linked list.**

**Algorithm:**

```c++
ListNode* addTwoNumbers(ListNode* l1, ListNode* l2) {
  int carry = 0;

  ListNode *t1 = l1, *t2 = l2;

  while(t1 && t2){
    int sum = t1->val + t2->val + carry;
    if(sum > 9){
      t1->val = sum%10;
      carry = 1;
    }else{
      t1->val = sum;
      carry = 0;
    }
    if(!t1->next){
      if(!t2->next && carry){
        t1->next = new ListNode(carry);
        return l1;
      }
      t1->next = t2->next;
      t1 = t1->next;
      break;
    }
    t1 = t1->next;
    t2 = t2->next;
  }
  while(t1 && carry){
    int sum = t1->val + carry;

    if(sum > 9){
      t1->val = sum%10;
      carry = 1;
    }else{
      t1->val = sum;
      carry = 0;
    }
    if(!t1->next && carry)
      break;
    t1 = t1->next;
  }
  if(carry)
    t1->next = new ListNode(carry);
  
  return l1;
}
```

This C++ implementation of the add two numbers algorithm is time-efficient and space-efficient. It uses O(n) time to iterate over the two linked lists and O(1) space to store the carry.
