# [138. Copy List with Random Pointer](https://leetcode.com/problems/copy-list-with-random-pointer/)

A linked list of length `n` is given such that each node contains an additional random pointer, which could point to any node in the list, or `null`.

Construct a [deep copy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_copying#Deep_copy) of the list. The deep copy should consist of exactly `n` brand new nodes, where each new node has its value set to the value of its corresponding original node. Both the `next` and `random` pointer of the new nodes should point to new nodes in the copied list such that the pointers in the original list and copied list represent the same list state. None of the pointers in the new list should point to nodes in the original list.

For example, if there are two nodes `X` and `Y` in the original list, where `X.random --> Y`, then for the corresponding two nodes `x` and `y` in the copied list, `x.random --> y`.

Return the head of the copied linked list.

The linked list is represented in the input/output as a list of n nodes. Each node is represented as a pair of `[val, random_index]` where:

- `val`: an integer representing `Node.val`
- `random_index`: the index of the node (range from `0` to `n-1`) that the `random` pointer points to, or `null` if it does not point to any node.

Your code will only be given the `head` of the original linked list.

 


**Example 1:**

>**Input:** head = [[7,null],[13,0],[11,4],[10,2],[1,0]]<br>
**Output:** [[7,null],[13,0],[11,4],[10,2],[1,0]]

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/12/18/e2.png)

>**Input:** head = [[1,1],[2,1]]<br>
**Output:** [[1,1],[2,1]]

**Example 3:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/12/18/e3.png)

>**Input:** head = [[3,null],[3,0],[3,null]]<br>
**Output:** [[3,null],[3,0],[3,null]]
 

**Constraints:**

- `0 <= n <= 1000`
- `-104 <= Node.val <= 1e4`
- `Node.random` is null or is pointing to some node in the linked list.

# Solution

The first approach uses an unordered map to store the mapping between the original nodes and the copied nodes. We iterate over the original linked list and create a copy of each node. We then store the mapping between the original node and the copied node in the unordered map. Finally, we iterate over the original linked list again and update the random pointers of the copied nodes to point to the corresponding copied nodes in the unordered map.

The second approach is similar to the first approach, but it uses a slightly different technique to update the random pointers of the copied nodes. We iterate over the original linked list and create a copy of each node. We then store the mapping between the original node and the copied node in the unordered map. Finally, we iterate over the copied linked list and update the random pointers of the copied nodes to point to the corresponding copied nodes in the unordered map.

Here is the pseudocode for the first approach in C++:

```c++ []
Node* copyRandomList(Node* head) {
  // Create an unordered map to store the mapping between the original nodes and
  // the copied nodes.
  unordered_map<Node*, Node*> mp;

  // Create a copy of the head node.
  Node* copy = new Node(head->val);

  // Add the copy node to the unordered map.
  mp[head] = copy;
  Node* t2 = copy 
  // Iterate over the original linked list and create a copy of each node.
  Node* temp = head->next;
  while (temp) {
    Node* newNode = new Node(temp->val);
    mp[temp] = newNode;
    t2->next = newNode;
    t2 = t2->next;
    temp = temp->next;
  }

  // Iterate over the original linked list again and update the random pointers
  // of the copied nodes to point to the corresponding copied nodes in the
  // unordered map.
  t2 = copy;
  temp = head;
  while (temp) {
    t2->random = mp[temp->random];
    t2 = t2->next;
    temp = temp->next;
  }

  // Return the head of the copied linked list.
  return copy;
}
```

Here is the pseudocode for the second approach in C++:

```c++ []
Node* copyRandomList(Node* head) {
  // Create an unordered map to store the mapping between the original nodes and
  // the copied nodes.
  unordered_map<Node*, Node*> mp;

  // Iterate over the original linked list and create a copy of each node.
  Node* temp = head;
  while (temp) {
    Node* newNode = new Node(temp->val);
    mp[temp] = newNode;
    temp = temp->next;
  }

  // Iterate over the copied linked list and update the random pointers of the
  // copied nodes to point to the corresponding copied nodes in the unordered
  // map.
  temp = head;
  while (temp) {
    mp[temp]->random = mp[temp->random];
    mp[temp]->next = mp[temp->next];
    temp = temp->next;
  }

  // Return the head of the copied linked list.
  return mp[head];
}
```

Both of these approaches are time-efficient and space-efficient. They use O(n) time and O(n) space to copy the linked list.
