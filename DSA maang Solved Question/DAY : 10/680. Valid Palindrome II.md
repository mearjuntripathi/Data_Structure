# [680. Valid Palindrome II](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-palindrome-ii/)

Given a string `s`, return true if the `s` can be palindrome after deleting at most one character from it.


**Example 1:**

> **Input:** s = "aba"<br>
**Output:** true

**Example 2:**

> **Input:** s = "abca"<br>
**Output:** true<br>
**Explanation:** You could delete the character 'c'.

**Example 3:**

> **Input:** s = "abc"<br>
**Output:** false
 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= s.length <= 105`
- `s` consists of lowercase English letters.

# Solution

The code I have provided is a recursive function that checks if a given string is a palindrome. A palindrome is a string that reads the same backward as forward.

The approach of the code is to first check if the first and last characters of the string are the same. If they are not, then the function returns false. Otherwise, the function recursively calls itself to check if the substring starting from the second character and the substring starting from the second last character are palindromes. If both of these substrings are palindromes, then the function returns true.

The algorithm of the code can be broken down into the following steps:

1. Check if the first and last characters of the string are the same.
2. If they are not, return false.
3. Otherwise, recursively call the function to check if the substring starting from the second character and the substring starting from the second last character are palindromes.
4. If both of these substrings are palindromes, return true.

Here is an explanation of the code:

```cpp
class Solution {
    bool is_palindrome(string &str,int start,int end){
        while(start<end){
            if(str[start] != str[end])
                return false;
            start ++;
            end--;
        }
        return true;
    }
public:
    bool validPalindrome(string s) {
        int start = 0;
        int end = s.length()-1;
        while(start < end){
            if(s[start] != s[end])
                return is_palindrome(s,start+1,end) || is_palindrome(s,start,end-1);
            start++;
            end--;
        }
        return true;
    }
};
```

The `is_palindrome()` function takes a string and two indices as input. The first index is the start index of the substring to be checked, and the second index is the end index of the substring to be checked. The function iterates over the substring and checks if each character is the same as the corresponding character at the opposite end of the substring. If all the characters are the same, then the function returns true. Otherwise, the function returns false.

The `validPalindrome()` function takes a string as input. The function first checks if the first and last characters of the string are the same. If they are not, then the function returns false. Otherwise, the function recursively calls the `is_palindrome()` function to check if the substring starting from the second character and the substring starting from the second last character are palindromes. If both of these substrings are palindromes, then the function returns true. Otherwise, the function returns false.
