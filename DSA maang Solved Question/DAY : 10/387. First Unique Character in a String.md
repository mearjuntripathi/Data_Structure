# [387. First Unique Character in a String](https://leetcode.com/problems/first-unique-character-in-a-string/)

Given a string `s`, find the first non-repeating character in it and return its index. If it does not exist, return `-1`.

 

**Example 1:**

> **Input:** s = "leetcode"<br>
**Output:** 0

**Example 2:**

> **Input:** s = "loveleetcode"<br>
**Output:** 2

**Example 3:**

> **Input:** s = "aabb"<br>
**Output:** -1
 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= s.length <= 105`
- `s` consists of only lowercase English letters.

# Solution

Sure, here is the approach and algorithm of the code:

**Approach:**

The approach of the code is to first create an array of 26 integers, where each integer represents the number of times a character appears in the string. This is done in the `for` loop from line 4 to 6.

Next, the code iterates through the string again, from line 8 to 11. For each character in the string, the code checks the corresponding integer in the array. If the value of the integer is 1, then the character is unique and the code returns the index of the character. Otherwise, the character is not unique and the code continues to the next iteration.

If the code reaches the end of the string without finding a unique character, then it returns -1.

**Algorithm:**

1. Create an array of 26 integers.
2. Iterate through the string and increment the corresponding integer in the array for each character.
3. Iterate through the string again.
4. For each character, check the corresponding integer in the array.
5. If the value of the integer is 1, then return the index of the character.
6. Otherwise, continue to the next iteration.
7. If the code reaches the end of the string without finding a unique character, then return -1.

```cpp
int firstUniqChar(string s) {
    if(s.length() == 1)
        return 0;
    
    int alfa[26] = {0};
    for(char c : s)
        alfa[c-'a']++;
    
    for(int i = 0 ; i < s.length() ; i++)
        if(alfa[s[i] - 'a'] == 1)
            return i;
    return -1;
}
```

Here is a more detailed explanation of the code:

* Line 1: The function `firstUniqChar()` takes a string as input.
* Line 2: The `if` statement checks if the length of the string is 1. If it is, then the function returns 0, which is the index of the first character in the string.
* Line 4 to 6: The `for` loop creates an array of 26 integers, where each integer represents the number of times a character appears in the string. The `alfa` array is initialized to all zeros.
* Line 8 to 11: The `for` loop iterates through the string. For each character in the string, the code increments the corresponding integer in the `alfa` array.
* Line 13 to 16: The `for` loop iterates through the string again. For each character in the string, the code checks the corresponding integer in the `alfa` array. If the value of the integer is 1, then the character is unique and the code returns the index of the character.
* Line 18: If the code reaches the end of the string without finding a unique character, then it returns -1.
