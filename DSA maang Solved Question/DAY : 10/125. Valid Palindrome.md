# [125. Valid Palindrome](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-palindrome/)

A phrase is a **palindrome** if, after converting all uppercase letters into lowercase letters and removing all non-alphanumeric characters, it reads the same forward and backward. Alphanumeric characters include letters and numbers.

Given a string `s`, return `true` if it is a palindrome, or `false` otherwise.

 

**Example 1:**

> **Input:** s = "A man, a plan, a canal: Panama"<br>
> **Output:** true<br>
> **Explanation:** "amanaplanacanalpanama" is a palindrome.

**Example 2:**

> **Input:** s = "race a car"<br>
> **Output:** false<br>
> **Explanation:** "raceacar" is not a palindrome.

**Example 3:**

> **Input:** s = " "<br>
> **Output:** true<br>
> **Explanation:** s is an empty string "" after removing non-alphanumeric characters.<br>
Since an empty string reads the same forward and backward, it is a palindrome.
 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= s.length <= 2 * 105`
- `s` consists only of printable ASCII characters.

# Solution

The code I have given me is a function named `isPalindrome()` that takes a string as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether the string is a palindrome. A palindrome is a word or phrase that reads the same backward as forward.

```cpp 
class Solution {
    bool check_alfa(char &ch){
        if((ch >= 'a' && ch <= 'z') || 
           (ch >= 'A' && ch <= 'Z') || 
           (ch >= '0' && ch <= '9')){
                if((ch >= 'A' && ch <= 'Z'))
                    ch = 'a' + (ch - 'A');
                return true;
        }
        else return false;
    }
public:
    bool isPalindrome(string s) {
        int i = 0 ;
        int j = s.length()-1;

        while(i<=j){
            if(!check_alfa(s[i])){
                i++;
            }else if(!check_alfa(s[j])){
                j--;
            }else{
                if(s[i] != s[j])
                    return false;
                else{
                    i++;
                    j--;
                }
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
};
```

**The algorithm of the function is as follows:**

1. Declare two variables, `i` and `j`, and initialize them to 0 and the length of the string minus 1, respectively.
2. While `i` is less than or equal to `j`:
    * Check if the character at index `i` of the string is alphanumeric. If it is not, then increment `i`.
    * Check if the character at index `j` of the string is alphanumeric. If it is not, then decrement `j`.
    * If the characters at indices `i` and `j` are not equal, then return `false`. Otherwise, increment `i` and decrement `j`.
3. Return `true`.

The first step of the algorithm declares two variables, `i` and `j`, which will be used to track the left and right ends of the string, respectively. The second step enters a loop that iterates until `i` is equal to or greater than `j`. In each iteration of the loop, the algorithm checks if the character at index `i` of the string is alphanumeric. If it is not, then the algorithm increments `i` and skips to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, the algorithm checks if the character at index `j` of the string is alphanumeric. If it is not, then the algorithm decrements `j` and skips to the next iteration of the loop. If the characters at indices `i` and `j` are not equal, then the algorithm returns `false`. Otherwise, the algorithm increments `i` and decrements `j`, and continues to the next iteration of the loop.

The third and final step of the algorithm returns `true` if the loop terminates without returning `false`. This means that all of the characters in the string were alphanumeric and that the string is a palindrome.
