# [242. Valid Anagram](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-anagram/)

Given two strings `s` and `t`, return `true` if `t is an anagram of `s`, and `false` otherwise.

An **Anagram** is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

**Example 1:**

> **Input:** s = "anagram", t = "nagaram"<br>
**Output:** true

**Example 2:**

> **Input:** s = "rat", t = "car"<br>
**Output:** false
 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= s.length, t.length <= 5 * 104`
- `s` and `t` consist of lowercase English letters.
 

**Follow up:** What if the inputs contain Unicode characters? How would you adapt your solution to such a case?

# Solution

**Approach:**

The approach is to use a frequency table to count the occurrences of each letter in the two strings. If the two strings are anagrams, then the frequency table for each string will be the same.

**Algorithm:**

1. Create a frequency table of size 26.
2. Iterate through the first string, and increment the frequency table for each letter.
3. Iterate through the second string, and decrement the frequency table for each letter.
4. Check if any of the values in the frequency table are not zero. If so, then the strings are not anagrams. Otherwise, the strings are anagrams.

Here is a more detailed explanation of each step:

```cpp
bool isAnagram(string s, string t) {
    int alfa[26] = {0};
    if(s.length() != t.length())
        return false;
    for(int i = 0 ; i < s.length() ; i++){
        alfa[s[i]-'a']++;
        alfa[t[i]-'a']--;
    }
    for(int i = 0 ; i < 26 ; i++)
        if(alfa[i] != 0)
            return false;
    return true;
}
```

1. Create a frequency table of size 26. This is an array that can store 26 integers, one for each letter of the alphabet.
2. Iterate through the first string, and increment the frequency table for each letter. This means that if the letter `a` appears in the string, then the value at index 0 of the frequency table will be incremented by 1.
3. Iterate through the second string, and decrement the frequency table for each letter. This is done in the same way as step 2.
4. Check if any of the values in the frequency table are not zero. If so, then the strings are not anagrams. This is because if the two strings are anagrams, then the frequency table for each string will be the same.

Here is another way to look at the algorithm. The algorithm first checks if the two strings have the same length. If they do not, then the strings cannot be anagrams. If they do have the same length, then the algorithm creates a frequency table for each string. The frequency table for a string is a list of the number of times each letter appears in the string. The algorithm then compares the two frequency tables. If the two frequency tables are the same, then the strings are anagrams. Otherwise, the strings are not anagrams.
