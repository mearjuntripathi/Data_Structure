# [337. House Robber III](https://leetcode.com/problems/house-robber-iii/)

The thief has found himself a new place for his thievery again. There is only one entrance to this area, called `root`.

Besides the `root`, each house has one and only one parent house. After a tour, the smart thief realized that all houses in this place form a binary tree. It will automatically contact the police if two directly-linked houses were broken into on the same night.

Given the `root` of the binary tree, return the maximum amount of money the thief can rob without alerting the police.

 


**Example 1:**

>**Input:** root = [3,2,3,null,3,null,1]<br>
**Output:** 7<br>
**Explanation:** Maximum amount of money the thief can rob = 3 + 3 + 1 = 7.

**Example 2:**

>**Input:** root = [3,4,5,1,3,null,1]<br>
**Output:** 9<br>
**Explanation:** Maximum amount of money the thief can rob = 4 + 5 = 9.
 

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 1e4].`
- `0 <= Node.val <= 1e4`

# Solution
**Approach**

This problem can be solved using a dynamic programming approach. The key insight is that the maximum value we can get from a subtree is either the maximum value we can get from its left subtree or the maximum value we can get from its right subtree, plus the value of the root node.

**Algorithm**

1. Define a recursive function `help(TreeNode *root)` that takes a pointer to a tree node as input and returns a pair of integers. The first integer in the pair represents the maximum value we can get from the subtree rooted at the node without robbing the node itself, and the second integer in the pair represents the maximum value we can get from the subtree rooted at the node by robbing the node itself.

2. In the base case of the recursion, if the input node is `NULL`, return the pair `{0, 0}`. This represents that the maximum value we can get from an empty subtree is 0, regardless of whether or not we rob the root node.

3. In the recursive step, recursively call the `help()` function on the left and right subtrees of the input node. Store the returned pairs of integers in variables `left` and `right`, respectively.

4. Calculate the maximum value we can get from the subtree rooted at the input node without robbing the node itself. This is the maximum of the first integers in the `left` and `right` pairs, plus the value of the input node.

5. Calculate the maximum value we can get from the subtree rooted at the input node by robbing the node itself. This is the sum of the second integers in the `left` and `right` pairs, plus the value of the input node.

6. Return the pair of integers containing the maximum values we calculated in steps 4 and 5.

**C++ Code**

```cpp
class Solution {
    pair<int,int> help(TreeNode *root){
        if(!root) return {0,0};

        pair<int,int> left = help(root->left);
        pair<int,int> right = help(root->right);
        pair<int,int> res = {0,0};

        res.first = max(left.first, left.second) + max(right.first, right.second);
        res.second = root->val + left.first + right.first;

        return res;
    }
public:
    int rob(TreeNode* root) {
        pair<int,int> res = help(root);
        return max(res.first, res.second);
    }
};
```

**Complexity Analysis**

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree. The space complexity of this solution is also O(n).
