# [399. Evaluate Division](https://leetcode.com/problems/evaluate-division/)

You are given an array of variable pairs equations and an array of real numbers values, where `equations[i] = [Ai, Bi]` and `values[i]` represent the equation `Ai / Bi = values[i]`. Each `Ai` or `Bi` is a string that represents a single variable.

You are also given some queries, where `queries[j] = [Cj, Dj]` represents the jth query where you must find the answer for `Cj / Dj = ?`.

Return the answers to all queries. If a single answer cannot be determined, return `-1.0`.

**Note:** The input is always valid. You may assume that evaluating the queries will not result in division by zero and that there is no contradiction.

**Note:** The variables that do not occur in the list of equations are undefined, so the answer cannot be determined for them.

 


**Example 1:**

>**Input:** equations = [["a","b"],["b","c"]], values = [2.0,3.0], queries = [["a","c"],["b","a"],["a","e"],["a","a"],["x","x"]]<br>
**Output:** [6.00000,0.50000,-1.00000,1.00000,-1.00000]<br>
**Explanation:**<br>
Given: a / b = 2.0, b / c = 3.0<br>
queries are: a / c = ?, b / a = ?, a / e = ?, a / a = ?, x / x = ? <br>
return: [6.0, 0.5, -1.0, 1.0, -1.0 ]<br>
note: x is undefined => -1.0

**Example 2:**

>**Input:** equations = [["a","b"],["b","c"],["bc","cd"]], values = [1.5,2.5,5.0], queries = [["a","c"],["c","b"],["bc","cd"],["cd","bc"]]<br>
**Output:** [3.75000,0.40000,5.00000,0.20000]

**Example 3:**

>**Input:** equations = [["a","b"]], values = [0.5], queries = [["a","b"],["b","a"],["a","c"],["x","y"]]<br>
**Output:** [0.50000,2.00000,-1.00000,-1.00000]

# Solution

This solution makes use of a graph to represent the relationships between the different currencies. The nodes of the graph represent the currencies and the edges represent the exchange rates between the currencies. The weight of an edge is the exchange rate from the source currency to the destination currency.

The algorithm works by first constructing a graph from the given equations. Then, for each query, the algorithm performs a depth-first search on the graph to find a path from the source currency to the destination currency. The weight of the path is the exchange rate between the two currencies.

If the algorithm is unable to find a path between the two currencies, then the query returns `-1`. Otherwise, the query returns the weight of the path.

Here is a summary of the algorithm:

1. Construct a graph from the given equations.
2. For each query:
    * Perform a depth-first search on the graph to find a path from the source currency to the destination currency.
    * If a path is found, return the weight of the path. Otherwise, return `-1`.

Here is a C++ implementation of the algorithm:

```c++
class Solution {
    unordered_map<string, double> mp;
    unordered_map<string, vector<string>> graph;
    void dfs(string &ai, string &bi, double &value, unordered_map<string, int> &visited, bool &found){
        visited[ai]++;
        if(found) return;
        for(auto it : graph[ai]){
            if(visited[it] != 1){
                value *= mp[ai+"->"+it];
                if(bi == it){
                    found = true;
                    return;
                }
                dfs(it,bi,value,visited,found);
                if(found) return;
                else value /= mp[ai+"->"+it];
            }
        }
    }

public:
    vector<double> calcEquation(vector<vector<string>>& equations, vector<double>& values, vector<vector<string>>& queries) {
        vector<double> result;

        int i = 0;
        for(auto equation : equations){
            string ai = equation[0];
            string bi = equation[1];

            mp[ai+"->"+bi] = values[i];
            mp[bi+"->"+ai] = 1/values[i];
            graph[bi].push_back(ai);
            graph[ai].push_back(bi);
            i++;
        }

        for(auto query : queries){
            string ai = query[0];
            string bi = query[1];

            if(graph.find(ai) == graph.end() || graph.find(bi) == graph.end()){
                result.push_back(-1);
                continue;
            }
            double value = 1;
            bool found = false;
            if(ai == bi){
                found = true;
            }else{
                unordered_map<string, int> visited;
                dfs(ai,bi,value,visited,found);
            }
            if(found)
                result.push_back(value);
            else 
                result.push_back(-1);
        }
        return result;
    }
};
