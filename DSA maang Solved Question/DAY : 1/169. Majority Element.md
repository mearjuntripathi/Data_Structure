# [169. Majority Element](https://leetcode.com/problems/majority-element/)
Given an array nums of size `, return the majority element.

The majority element is the element that appears more than `âŒŠn / 2âŒ‹` times. You may assume that the majority element always exists in the array.
**Example 1:**

>**Input:** nums = [3,2,3]<br>
>**Output:** 3

**Example 2:**

>**Input:** nums = [2,2,1,1,1,2,2]<br>
>**Output:** 2
 

**Constraints:**
> `n == nums.length`<br>
> `1 <= n <= 5 * 104`<br>
> `-109 <= nums[i] <= 109`
 

***Follow-up:** Could you solve the problem in linear time and in `O(1)` space*

## Solution
**Approach:** 

The code uses the Boyer-Moore majority vote algorithm to find the majority element in an array. The algorithm works by maintaining a candidate element and a count of the number of times that element has been seen. Initially, the candidate element is the first element in the array and the count is set to 1. Then, the algorithm iterates over the rest of the array. For each element, if the element is equal to the candidate element, then the count is incremented. Otherwise, the count is decremented. If the count ever reaches 0, then the candidate element is set to the current element and the count is set to 1.

**Algorithm:**

1. Initialize a candidate element to the first element in the array.
2. Initialize a count to 1.
3. Iterate over the rest of the array:
    * If the current element is equal to the candidate element, then increment the count.
    * Otherwise, decrement the count.
    * If the count reaches 0, then set the candidate element to the current element and set the count to 1.
4. Return the candidate element.

This algorithm works because, if there is a majority element in the array, then the algorithm will eventually set the candidate element to that element and the count will be greater than 0. Otherwise, the algorithm will never set the count to greater than 0, which means that there is no majority element in the array.

This algorithm has a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(1).


**Here is an explanation of the code you have provided:**

    int majorityElement(vector<int>& nums) {
        int majority = nums[0];
        int count = 0;
        for(int i = 0; i < nums.size() ; i++){
            if(count == 0){
                majority = nums[i];
                count = 1;
            }else{
                if(nums[i] == majority)
                    count ++;
                else count--;
            }
        }
        return majority;        
    }

* The first line declares the function `majorityElement`, which takes a vector of integers as input and returns the majority element in the vector.
* The second line declares the variables `majority` and `count`. The variable `majority` stores the candidate element and the variable `count` stores the number of times that element has been seen.
* The third line starts the loop that iterates over the vector of integers.
* The fourth line checks if the `count` is `0`. If it is, then the algorithm sets the candidate element to the current element and sets the `count` to `1`.
* The fifth line checks if the current element is equal to the candidate element. If it is, then the algorithm increments the count. Otherwise, the algorithm decrements the count.
* The sixth line goes back to the top of the loop.
* The seventh line returns the candidate element.
