# [283. Move Zeroes](https://leetcode.com/problems/move-zeroes/)
Given an integer array nums, move all 0's to the end of it while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.

***Note:** that you must do this in-place without making a copy of the array.*

**Example 1:**

> **Input:** nums = [0,1,0,3,12]<br>
> **Output:** [1,3,12,0,0]

**Example 2:**

> **Input:** nums = [0]<br>
> **Output:** [0]
 

**Constraints:**

> `1 <= nums.length <= 104`<br>
> `-231 <= nums[i] <= 231 - 1`
 

***Follow up:** Could you minimize the total number of operations done?*

## Solution

**Approach:**

The approach is to maintain two pointers, `low` and `pos`. The `low` pointer points to the first non-zero element in the array. The `pos` pointer points to the current element in the array.

We iterate through the array, and if the current element is non-zero, we swap it with the element at the `low` pointer. We then increment both pointers.

If the current element is zero, we simply increment the `pos` pointer.

**Algorithm:**

    void moveZeroes(vector<int>& nums) {
      int low = 0;
      int pos = 0;
      int size = nums.size();

      while (low < size && pos < size) {
        if (nums[low] == 0 && nums[pos] == 0) {
          pos++;
        } else {
          if (nums[low] == 0 && nums[pos] != 0) {
            nums[low] = nums[pos];
            nums[pos] = 0;
          }
          low++;
          pos++;
        }
      }
    }
**Explanation:**

The first step is to initialize the `low` and `pos` pointers. The `low` pointer is initialized to 0, and the pos pointer is initialized to 0. The `size` variable stores the number of elements in the array.
