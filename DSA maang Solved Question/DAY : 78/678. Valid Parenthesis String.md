# [678. Valid Parenthesis String](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-parenthesis-string/)

Given a string s containing only three types of characters: `'('`, `')'` and `'*'`, return true if `s` is valid.

The following rules define a valid string:

- Any left parenthesis `'('` must have a corresponding right parenthesis `')'`.
- Any right parenthesis `')'` must have a corresponding left parenthesis `'('`.
- Left parenthesis `'('` must go before the corresponding right parenthesis `')'`.
- `'*'` could be treated as a single right parenthesis `')'` or a single left parenthesis `'('` or an empty string `""`.


**Example 1:**

>**Input:** s = "()"<br>
**Output:** true

**Example 2:**

>**Input:** s = "(*)"<br>
**Output:** true

**Example 3:**

>**Input:** s = "(*))"<br>
**Output:** true
 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= s.length <= 100`
- `s[i]` is `'('`, `')'` or `'*'`.

# Solution

Sure, here is an algorithm, approach, and code implementation in C++ for checking if a given string is a valid parentheses string:

**Algorithm:**

1. Initialize two counters `low` and `high` to 0.
2. Iterate through the characters of the string.
3. For each character:
    a. If the character is '(' increment both `low` and `high`.
    b. If the character is ')':
        i. Decrement `high`.
        ii. If `high` is less than 0, return `false`.
        iii. Decrement `low` to `max(low - 1, 0)`.
    c. If the character is '*':
        i. Decrement `low` to `max(low - 1, 0)`.
        ii. Increment `high`.
4. If `low` is equal to 0, return `true`; otherwise, return `false`.

**Approach:**

The algorithm works by keeping track of two counts: `low` and `high`. `low` represents the minimum number of opening parentheses that need to be closed, while `high` represents the maximum number of closing parentheses that can be added.

At each step, the algorithm updates the `low` and `high` counts based on the current character. If the character is '(' or '*', `low` is incremented. If the character is ')', `high` is decremented. If `high` becomes negative, it means that there are more closing parentheses than opening parentheses, and the string is not valid.

After iterating through the entire string, if `low` is equal to 0, it means that all opening parentheses have been closed, and the string is valid. Otherwise, the string is not valid.

**Code implementation in C++:**

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    bool checkValidString(string s) {
        int low = 0;
        int high = 0;

        for (auto &ch : s) {
            if (ch == '(') {
                low++;
                high++;
            } else if (ch == ')') {
                low = max(low - 1, 0);
                high--;
                if (high < 0) return false;
            } else if (ch == '*') {
                low = max(low - 1, 0);
                high++;
            }
        }
        return low == 0;
    }
};
```
