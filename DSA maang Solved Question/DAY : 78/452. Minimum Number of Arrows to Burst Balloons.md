# [452. Minimum Number of Arrows to Burst Balloons](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-number-of-arrows-to-burst-balloons/)

There are some spherical balloons taped onto a flat wall that represents the XY-plane. The balloons are represented as a 2D integer array `points` where `points[i] = [xstart, xend]` denotes a balloon whose horizontal diameter stretches between `xstart` and `xend`. You do not know the exact y-coordinates of the balloons.

Arrows can be shot up directly vertically (in the positive y-direction) from different points along the x-axis. A balloon with `xstart` and `xend` is burst by an arrow shot at `x` if `xstart <= x <= xend`. There is no limit to the number of arrows that can be shot. A shot arrow keeps traveling up infinitely, bursting any balloons in its path.

Given the array `points`, return the minimum number of arrows that must be shot to burst all balloons.

**Example 1:**

>**Input:** points = [[10,16],[2,8],[1,6],[7,12]]<br>
**Output:** 2<br>
**Explanation:** The balloons can be burst by 2 arrows:
>- Shoot an arrow at x = 6, bursting the balloons [2,8] and [1,6].
>- Shoot an arrow at x = 11, bursting the balloons [10,16] and [7,12].

**Example 2:**

>**Input:** points = [[1,2],[3,4],[5,6],[7,8]]<br>
**Output:** 4<br>
**Explanation:** One arrow needs to be shot for each balloon for a total of 4 arrows.

**Example 3:**

>**Input:** points = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[4,5]]<br>
**Output:** 2<br>
**Explanation:** The balloons can be burst by 2 arrows:
>- Shoot an arrow at x = 2, bursting the balloons [1,2] and [2,3].
>- Shoot an arrow at x = 4, bursting the balloons [3,4] and [4,5].
 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= points.length <= 1e5`
- `points[i].length == 2`
- `-2^31 <= xstart < xend <= 2^31 - 1`

# Solution
Here's the algorithm, approach, and C++ code for finding the minimum number of arrows needed to shoot down all balloons:

**Algorithm:**

1. Sort the `points` vector in ascending order of `x`-coordinates. This will group balloons with overlapping `x`-ranges together.

2. Initialize a counter `count` to track the number of arrows needed and a temporary interval `tempInterval` to store the current balloon's range.

3. Iterate through the sorted `points` vector. For each balloon:
    a. Check if the current balloon's `x`-coordinate falls within the current interval's `x`-range.
       i. If it does, update the interval's end `y`-coordinate to the minimum of the current balloon's `y`-coordinate and the interval's current `y`-coordinate. This represents merging overlapping intervals.
    b. Otherwise, increment the counter `count` since a new interval needs to be established. Set the current balloon's range as the new interval.

4. After processing all balloons, return `count + 1`. The `+ 1` accounts for the last balloon that gets added to the counter in the loop.

**Approach:**

The approach is to sort the balloons by their `x`-coordinates to group balloons with overlapping `x`-ranges together. Then, iterate through the sorted balloons, maintaining a temporary interval to represent the current group of overlapping balloons. Update the interval as needed and increment the counter when a new interval needs to be established. This effectively keeps track of the minimum number of intervals required to cover all balloons.

**C++ Code:**

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int findMinArrowShots(vector<vector<int>>& points) {
        int count = 0;
        sort(points.begin(), points.end());

        vector<int> tempInterval = points[0];
        for(auto point : points){
            if(point[0] <= tempInterval[1])
                tempInterval[1] = min(point[1], tempInterval[1]);
            else{
                count++;
                tempInterval = point;
            }
        }
        return count+1;
    }
};
```
