# [134. Gas Station](https://leetcode.com/problems/gas-station/)

There are `n` gas stations along a circular route, where the amount of gas at the `ith` station is `gas[i]`.

You have a car with an unlimited gas tank and it costs `cost[i]` of gas to travel from the ith station to its next `(i + 1)th` station. You begin the journey with an empty tank at one of the gas stations.

Given two integer arrays `gas` and `cost`, return the starting gas station's index if you can travel around the circuit once in the clockwise direction, otherwise return `-1`. If there exists a solution, it is guaranteed to be unique

**Example 1:**

>**Input:** gas = [1,2,3,4,5], cost = [3,4,5,1,2]<br>
**Output:** 3<br>
**Explanation:**<br>
Start at station 3 (index 3) and fill up with 4 unit of gas. Your tank = 0 + 4 = 4<br>
Travel to station 4. Your tank = 4 - 1 + 5 = 8<br>
Travel to station 0. Your tank = 8 - 2 + 1 = 7<br>
Travel to station 1. Your tank = 7 - 3 + 2 = 6<br>
Travel to station 2. Your tank = 6 - 4 + 3 = 5<br>
Travel to station 3. The cost is 5. Your gas is just enough to travel back to station 3.<br>
Therefore, return 3 as the starting index.

**Example 2:**

>**Input:** gas = [2,3,4], cost = [3,4,3]<br>
**Output:** -1<br>
**Explanation:**<br>
You can't start at station 0 or 1, as there is not enough gas to travel to the next station.<br>
Let's start at station 2 and fill up with 4 unit of gas. Your tank = 0 + 4 = 4<br>
Travel to station 0. Your tank = 4 - 3 + 2 = 3<br>
Travel to station 1. Your tank = 3 - 3 + 3 = 3<br>
You cannot travel back to station 2, as it requires 4 unit of gas but you only have 3.<br>
Therefore, you can't travel around the circuit once no matter where you start.
 

**Constraints:**

- `n == gas.length == cost.length`
- `1 <= n <= 1e5`
- `0 <= gas[i], cost[i] <= 1e4`

# Solution
Sure, here is an algorithm and approach for solving the problem of determining whether a circular tour can be completed in a given gas station network, along with the C++ code implementation:

**Problem:**

Given a circular gas station network where each station has a certain amount of gas and a certain amount of cost, determine whether a circular tour can be completed starting from any station.

**Algorithm:**

1. Initialize variables:
    * `total_gas`: Total amount of gas in the network.
    * `total_cost`: Total cost of traversing the network.
    * `curr_gas`: Current amount of gas available.
    * `starting_point`: Potential starting point for a complete circular tour.

2. Iterate through the gas station network:
    a. Update `total_gas` by adding the gas at the current station.
    b. Update `total_cost` by adding the cost of traversing to the current station.
    c. Update `curr_gas` by adding the gas at the current station and subtracting the cost of traversing to the current station.
    d. Check if `curr_gas` is negative.
        i. If `curr_gas` is negative, set `starting_point` to the next station and reset `curr_gas` to zero.

3. Check if a complete circular tour is possible:
    a. If `total_gas` is less than `total_cost`, return `-1` indicating that no complete circular tour is possible.
    b. Otherwise, return `starting_point` indicating the potential starting point for a complete circular tour.

**C++ Code Implementation:**

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int canCompleteCircuit(vector<int>& gas, vector<int>& cost) {
        int n = gas.size();
        int total_gas = 0;
        int total_cost = 0;
        int curr_gas = 0;
        int starting_point = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            total_gas += gas[i];
            total_cost += cost[i];
            curr_gas += gas[i] - cost[i];

            if (curr_gas < 0) {
                starting_point = i + 1;
                curr_gas = 0;
            }
        }

        return (total_gas < total_cost) ? -1 : starting_point;
    }
};
```

This code implementation efficiently determines whether a circular tour can be completed in the given gas station network and returns the potential starting point for a complete circular tour if possible.
