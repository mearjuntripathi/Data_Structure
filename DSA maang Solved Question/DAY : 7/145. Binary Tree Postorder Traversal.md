## Solution

### Recursive Solution

The code you have provided implements the postorder traversal of a binary tree. The postorder traversal visits a node after its left and right subtrees have been visited.

The algorithm works as follows:

1. The function `recursiveTraversal()` takes two arguments: the root node of the tree and a vector to store the values of the nodes in postorder traversal.
2. If the root node is null, then the function returns.
3. Otherwise, the function recursively calls itself to traverse the left subtree of the root node.
4. The function then recursively calls itself to traverse the right subtree of the root node.
5. Finally, the function pushes the value of the root node into the vector.

The function `postorderTraversal()` simply calls the function `recursiveTraversal()`.

    class Solution {
        void recursiveTraversal(TreeNode* root, vector<int>& values){
            if(!root)  return;
            recursiveTraversal(root->left,values);
            recursiveTraversal(root->right, values);
            values.push_back(root->val);
        }
    public:
        vector<int> postorderTraversal(TreeNode* root) {
            if(!root) return{};
            vector<int> values;

            // Recursive Solution
            recursiveTraversal(root,values);
            return values;
        }
    };

**Here is a more detailed explanation of the algorithm:**

* The first step is to check if the root node is null. If it is, then the function returns immediately.
* Otherwise, the function recursively calls itself to traverse the left subtree of the root node. This ensures that the left subtree is traversed before the right subtree.
* After the left subtree has been traversed, the function recursively calls itself to traverse the right subtree.
* Finally, the function pushes the value of the root node into the vector. This ensures that the root node is visited after its left and right subtrees.

The postorder traversal is a depth-first traversal of a binary tree. It is often used to print the values of a binary tree in reverse order.

### Iterative Approach

The postorder traversal of a binary tree is a recursive traversal that visits the left subtree, then the right subtree, and then the root node. The following is an iterative implementation of postorder traversal:

    vector<int> postorderTraversal(TreeNode* root) {
        if(!root) return{};
        vector<int> values;
        TreeNode *dummy = root;
        while(dummy){
            if(!dummy->right){
                values.push_back(dummy->val);
                dummy = dummy->left;
            }else{
                TreeNode* temp = dummy->right;
                while(temp->left && temp->left != dummy){
                    temp = temp->left;
                }

                if(!temp->left){
                    temp->left = dummy;
                    values.push_back(dummy->val);
                    dummy = dummy->right;
                }else{
                    temp->left = NULL;
                    dummy = dummy->left;
                }

            }
        }
        reverse(values.begin(), values.end());
        return values;
    } 

1. Create a dummy node and set it to the root node.
2. Create an empty vector to store the postorder traversal results.
3. While the dummy node is not null:
    * If the dummy node does not have a right child:
        * Add the dummy node's value to the vector.
        * Set the dummy node to the dummy node's left child.
    * Otherwise:
        * Create a temporary node and set it to the dummy node's right child.
        * While the temporary node's left child is not null and the temporary node's left child is not the dummy node:
            * Set the temporary node to the temporary node's left child.
        * If the temporary node's left child is null:
            * Set the temporary node's left child to the dummy node.
            * Add the dummy node's value to the vector.
            * Set the dummy node to the dummy node's right child.
        * Otherwise:
            * Set the temporary node's left child to null.
            * Set the dummy node to the dummy node's left child.
4. Reverse the vector and return it.

### Iterative Method using stack

The code you have provided implements the postorder traversal of a binary tree using a stack. 

    vector<int> postorderTraversal(TreeNode* root) {
        if(!root) return{};
        vector<int> values;
        stack<TreeNode*> st;
        st.push(root);

        while(!st.empty()){
            root = st.top();
            if(root->right) 
                st.push(root->right);
            if(root->left) 
                st.push(root->left);

            if(root->right==NULL && root->left == NULL){
                st.pop();
                values.push_back(root->val);
            }
            root->left = root->right = NULL;
        }

        return values;
    }

The approach is as follows:

1. Create an empty stack and push the root node of the tree onto the stack.
2. While the stack is not empty, do the following:
    * Pop the top node from the stack and store it in a variable `root`.
    * Push `root`'s right child onto the stack.
    * Push `root`'s left child onto the stack.
    * If `root` has no right child and no left child, then print the value of `root` and remove it from the stack.

The algorithm can be broken down into the following steps:

1. Initialize a stack `st` and push the root node of the tree onto the stack.
2. Create an empty vector `values` to store the postorder traversal results.
3. While the stack is not empty, do the following:
    * Pop the top node from the stack and store it in a variable `root`.
    * Push `root`'s right child onto the stack.
    * Push `root`'s left child onto the stack.
    * If `root` has no right child and no left child, then add `root`'s value to the `values` vector.
4. Return the `values` vector.

This algorithm works by first pushing the root node of the tree onto the stack. Then, it repeatedly pops the top node from the stack and pushes its right and left child nodes onto the stack. If the popped node has no right child and no left child, then its value is added to the `values` vector. This process continues until the stack is empty.

The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree. The space complexity of this algorithm is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree. This is because the stack can hold up to n nodes at any given time.
