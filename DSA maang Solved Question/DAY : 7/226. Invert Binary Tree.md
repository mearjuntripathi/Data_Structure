> **Input:** root = [4,2,7,1,3,6,9]<br>
> **Output:** [4,7,2,9,6,3,1]

**Example 2:**

> **Input:** root = [2,1,3]<br>
> **Output:** [2,3,1]

**Example 3:**

> **Input:** root = []<br>
> **Output:** []
 

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 100]`.
- `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`

## Solution

The code you have provided is a recursive function that inverts a binary tree. A binary tree is a tree data structure in which each node has at most two children, called the left child and the right child. The invertTree() function takes a pointer to the root node of the binary tree as input and returns a pointer to the inverted tree.
```cpp
TreeNode* invertTree(TreeNode* root) {
    if(!root)
        return root;
    
    // swap(root->right, root->left);
    // invertTree(root->left);
    // invertTree(root->right);
    
    TreeNode* temp = root->left;
    root->left = invertTree(root->right);
    root->right = invertTree(temp);
    return root;
}
```
The algorithm of the invertTree() function is as follows:

1. If the root node is null, then the tree is empty and there is no need to invert it. Return the root node.
2. Otherwise, swap the left and right children of the root node.
3. Recursively invert the left subtree of the root node.
4. Recursively invert the right subtree of the root node.
5. Return the root node.

The first step of the algorithm checks if the root node is null. If it is, then the tree is empty and there is no need to invert it. The function simply returns the root node.

The second step of the algorithm swaps the left and right children of the root node. This effectively inverts the subtree rooted at the root node.

The third and fourth steps of the algorithm recursively invert the left and right subtrees of the root node, respectively. This ensures that the entire tree is inverted.

The fifth step of the algorithm returns the root node. This is the inverted tree.

The approach used in the code is the recursive approach. The problem of inverting a binary tree is broken down into smaller subproblems, each of which is the inversion of a subtree. The function invertTree() recursively solves these subproblems and then combines the solutions to obtain the solution to the original problem.
