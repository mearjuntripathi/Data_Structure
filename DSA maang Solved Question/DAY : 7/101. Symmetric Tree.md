# [101. Symmetric Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/symmetric-tree/)

Given the `root` of a binary tree, check whether it is a mirror of itself (i.e., symmetric around its center).


**Example 1:**

> **Input:** root = [1,2,2,3,4,4,3]<br>
> **Output:** true

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/02/19/symtree2.jpg)

> **Input:** root = [1,2,2,null,3,null,3]<br>
> **Output:** false
 

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 1000]`.
- `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`
 

***Follow up:** Could you solve it both recursively and iteratively?*

## Solution

### Recursive Technique

1. Recursively check if the left subtree and the right subtree are symmetric.
2. A subtree is symmetric if the following conditions are met:
    * Both subtrees are empty.
    * Both subtrees have only one node, and the value of the node in the left subtree is equal to the value of the node in the right subtree.
    * The left subtree is symmetric and the right subtree is symmetric.

The algorithm is as follows:

    class Solution {
        bool check(TreeNode *leftNode, TreeNode *rightNode){
            if(leftNode == NULL || rightNode == NULL)
                return leftNode == rightNode;
            
            return  leftNode->val == rightNode->val &&
                    check(leftNode->left, rightNode->right) && 
                    check(leftNode->right, rightNode->left);
        }
    public:
        bool isSymmetric(TreeNode* root) {
            return !root || check(root->left, root->right);
        }
    };


The first function, `isSymmetric()`, takes a binary tree as input and returns True if the tree is symmetric, and False otherwise. The second function, `check()`, takes two subtrees as input and returns True if the subtrees are symmetric, and False otherwise.

I hope this explanation is clear. Let me know if you have any other questions.

**Here are some additional details about the algorithm:**

* The algorithm is recursive because it breaks down the problem of checking if a binary tree is symmetric into smaller problems of checking if two subtrees are symmetric.
* The algorithm is efficient because it only needs to visit each node in the tree once.
* The algorithm is correct because it correctly identifies all binary trees that are symmetric and all binary trees that are not symmetric.

### Iterative Approach

The code you have provided is a function called `isSymmetric()` that takes a binary tree `root` as its input and returns a boolean value indicating whether the tree is symmetric.

    bool isSymmetric(TreeNode* root) {
        if(!root) true;
        stack<TreeNode*>st;
        st.push(root->left);
        st.push(root->right);

        while(!st.empty()){
            TreeNode* l = st.top();
            st.pop();
            TreeNode* r = st.top();
            st.pop();

            if(l == NULL && r == NULL)
                continue;

            if(l == NULL || r == NULL || l->val != r->val)
                return false;
            
            st.push(l->left);
            st.push(r->right);

            st.push(l->right);
            st.push(r->left);
        }
        return true;
    }

The algorithm of the function is as follows:

1. Check if the tree is empty. If it is, return `true`.
2. Create a stack `st` and push the left and right children of the root node onto the stack.
3. While the stack is not empty:
    * Pop the top two elements of the stack, `l` and `r`.
    * If `l` and `r` are both null, continue.
    * If either `l` or `r` is null, or if the values of `l` and `r` are not equal, return `false`.
    * Push the left and right children of `l` and `r` onto the stack.
4. Return `true`.

The approach of the function is to use a recursive algorithm. The function starts by checking if the tree is empty. If it is, the function returns `true`. Otherwise, the function pushes the left and right children of the root node onto a stack. The function then enters a loop. In each iteration of the loop, the function pops the top two elements of the stack, `l` and `r`. If `l` and `r` are both null, the function continues to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, the function checks if either `l` or `r` is null, or if the values of `l` and `r` are not equal. If either of these conditions is met, the function returns `false`. Otherwise, the function pushes the left and right children of `l` and `r` onto the stack. The function continues looping until the stack is empty. Finally, the function returns `true`.
