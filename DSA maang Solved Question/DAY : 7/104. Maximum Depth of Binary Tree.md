# [104. Maximum Depth of Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-depth-of-binary-tree/)

Given the `root` of a binary tree, return its *maximum depth*.

A binary tree's **maximum depth** is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.

**Example 1:**

![example](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/11/26/tmp-tree.jpg)

> **Input:** root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]<br>
> **Output:** 3

**Example 2:**

> **Input:** root = [1,null,2] <br>
> **Output:** 2
 

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 104]`.
- `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`

## Solution
```cpp
int maxDepth(TreeNode* root) {
    if(!root) return 0;

    int leftNode = maxDepth(root->left);
    int rightNode = maxDepth(root->right);

    return max(leftNode, rightNode)+1;
}
```

1. If the tree is empty, return 0.
2. Otherwise, let the maximum depths of the left subtree and right subtree be `leftNode` and `rightNode`, respectively.
3. Return the maximum of `leftNode` and `rightNode` plus 1.

In other words, the maximum depth of a binary tree is the number of nodes on the longest path from the root node to a leaf node. This algorithm finds the maximum depth by recursively finding the maximum depths of the left and right subtrees, and then taking the maximum of those two values plus 1.

Here is an explanation of the code:

* The function `maxDepth()` takes a pointer to the root node of the binary tree as input.
* The first line checks if the tree is empty. If it is, the function returns 0 immediately.
* Otherwise, the function recursively calls itself to find the maximum depths of the left and right subtrees.
* The last line returns the maximum of `leftNode` and `rightNode` plus 1.

This algorithm is efficient because it only visits each node once. The time complexity of the algorithm is O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the tree. The space complexity of the algorithm is O(N), because the function call stack can grow up to N levels deep.
