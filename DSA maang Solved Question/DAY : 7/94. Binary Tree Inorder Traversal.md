Given the `root` of a binary tree, return the inorder traversal of its nodes' values.

 

**Example 1:**

<br>
> **Input:** root = [1,null,2,3]<br>
> **Output:** [1,3,2]

**Example 2:**
<br>
> **Input:** root = []<br>
> **Output:** []

**Example 3:**
<br>
> **Input:** root = [1]<br>
> **Output:** [1]
 

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 100]`.
- `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`
 

***Follow up:** Recursive solution is trivial, could you do it iteratively?*

## Solution

### A Recursive Solution


1. **Initialize a vector `values` to store the inorder traversal results.**
2. **Recursively call the `recursiveTraversal()` function on the root node and the `values` vector.**
    * The `recursiveTraversal()` function takes two parameters: the root node of the subtree and the `values` vector.
    * If the root node is null, then return.
    * Otherwise, do the following:
        * Recursively call the `recursiveTraversal()` function on the left subtree of the root node and the `values` vector.
        * Add the value of the root node to the `values` vector.
        * Recursively call the `recursiveTraversal()` function on the right subtree of the root node and the `values` vector.
3. **Return the `values` vector.**

        class Solution {

        void recursiveTraversal(TreeNode* root, vector<int>& values){
            if(!root)  return;
            recursiveTraversal(root->left,values);
            values.push_back(root->val);
            recursiveTraversal(root->right, values);
        }

        public:
            vector<int> inorderTraversal(TreeNode* root) {
                if(!root) return {};
                vector<int> values;

                // Recurtion Solution
                recursiveTraversal(root, values);

                return values;
            }
        };

The inorder traversal of a binary tree visits the left subtree of a node first, then the node itself, and then the right subtree of the node. This ensures that the elements in the `values` vector are in sorted order (ascending order if the tree is a binary search tree).

### Iteration Soltion

The inorder traversal algorithm visits the left subtree of a node, then the node itself, and then the right subtree. The iteration implementation of this algorithm works as follows:

    vector<int> inorderTraversal(TreeNode* root) {
        if(!root) return {};
        vector<int> values;

        TreeNode *dummy = root;

        while(dummy){
            if(!dummy->left){
                values.push_back(dummy->val);
                dummy = dummy->right;
            }else{
                TreeNode *temp = dummy->left;
                TreeNode *p = dummy->left;

                while(temp->right)  temp = temp->right;
                
                dummy->left = NULL;
                temp->right = dummy;
                dummy = p;
            }
        }

        return values;
    }

1. The function takes the root node of the binary tree as input.
2. If the root node is null, then the function returns an empty list.
3. Otherwise, the function does the following:
    * Create a new node called `dummy` and set it to the root node.
    * Create a list called `values` to store the inorder traversal of the binary tree.
    * While `dummy` is not null, do the following:
        * If `dummy` does not have a left child, then add `dummy`'s value to the `values` list and set `dummy` to its right child.
        * Otherwise, do the following:
            * Create a temporary node called `temp` and set it to `dummy`'s left child.
            * While `temp` has a right child, set `temp` to its right child.
            * Set `dummy`'s left child to null.
            * Set `temp`'s right child to `dummy`.
            * Set `dummy` to `temp`.
4. The function returns the `values` list.

This algorithm works by first visiting the left subtree of the root node. Then, it visits the root node itself. Finally, it visits the right subtree of the root node. This ensures that the nodes of the binary tree are visited in inorder traversal order.

### Iteration Solution using Stack

The algorithm works as follows:

1. Create an empty stack `st`.
2. Initialize a dummy node `dummy` as the root node.
3. While `dummy` is not null or the stack is not empty:
    * If `dummy` is not null:
        * Push `dummy` onto the stack.
        * Set `dummy` to its left child.
    * Otherwise:
        * Pop the top element `node` from the stack.
        * Add `node`'s value to the results.
        * Set `dummy` to `node`'s right child.


This is a recursive algorithm, but it can also be implemented iteratively using a stack. The stack is used to keep track of the nodes that have not yet been visited.

    vector<int> inorderTraversal(TreeNode* root) {
        if(!root) return {};
        vector<int> values;
        stack<TreeNode *> st;
        TreeNode *dummy = root;
        while(true){
            if(dummy){
                st.push(dummy);
                dummy = dummy->left;
            }else{
                if(st.empty())
                    break;
                dummy = st.top();
                st.pop();
                values.push_back(dummy->val);
                dummy = dummy->right;
            }
        }
        return values;
    }

**Here is an explanation of the code:**

* The function `inorderTraversal()` takes a pointer to the root node of the binary tree as input.
* The first line checks if the root node is null. If it is, the function returns an empty vector.
* The next line creates an empty vector to store the results of the traversal.
* The third line creates a stack to keep track of the nodes that have not yet been visited.
* The fourth line initializes a dummy node as the root node.
* The fifth line is the main loop of the algorithm. It continues to run as long as `dummy` is not null or the stack is not empty.
* In each iteration of the loop, the following steps are performed:
    * If `dummy` is not null, it is pushed onto the stack.
    * `dummy` is set to its left child.
    * Otherwise, the top element `node` is popped from the stack.
    * The value of `node` is added to the results.
    * `dummy` is set to `node`'s right child.

The function returns the vector of results.
