**Example 1:**

<br>
>Input: root = [1,null,2,3]<br>
>Output: [1,2,3]<br>

**Example 2:**
<br>
>Input: root = []<br>
>Output: []<br>

**Example 3:**
>Input: root = [1]<br>
>Output: [1]<br>
 

**Constraints:**

* The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 100]`.
* `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`

## Solution

### A Recursive Approach

The code you have given me implements a recursive preorder traversal of a binary tree. The algorithm works as follows:

1. The `preorderTraversal()` function takes a pointer to the root node of the binary tree as input.
2. If the root node is null, then the function returns an empty vector.
3. Otherwise, the function does the following:
    * Pushes the value of the root node into a vector.
    * Recursively calls the `preorderTraversal()` function on the left subtree of the root node.
    * Recursively calls the `preorderTraversal()` function on the right subtree of the root node.

The `recurtionTraversal()` function is a helper function that is used to recursively traverse the binary tree. The algorithm of this function is similar to the algorithm of the `preorderTraversal()` function, except that it does not return anything.
```cpp
    class Solution {
        void recurtionTraversal(TreeNode* root, vector<int> &values){
            if(root == NULL)
                return;
            values.push_back(root->val);
            recurtionTraversal(root->left, values);
            recurtionTraversal(root->right, values);        
        }
    public:
        vector<int> preorderTraversal(TreeNode* root) {
            if(root == NULL)
                return {};
            // Recution technique
            vector<int> values;
            recurtionTraversal(root, values);
            return values;       
        }
    };
```
**Here is a more detailed explanation of the algorithm:**

* The first step, checking if the root node is null, is necessary because we do not want to recurse into a subtree that does not exist.
* The second step, pushing the value of the root node into the vector, is where the actual traversal takes place. This is the only step that is different from the algorithm of the `preorderTraversal()` function.
* The third step, recursively calling the `preorderTraversal()` function on the left subtree of the root node, ensures that the left subtree is traversed before the right subtree.
* The fourth step, recursively calling the `preorderTraversal()` function on the right subtree of the root node, ensures that the right subtree is traversed after the left subtree.

This algorithm is a recursive approach to traversing a binary tree. It is a simple and efficient way to traverse a binary tree, but it can be more space-consuming than an iterative approach.

### A Iterative Approach - An Optimal way
The algorithm works as follows:

1. Create a vector to store the values of the nodes in the preorder traversal.
2. Create a dummy node and set it to the root node.
3. While the dummy node is not null:
    * If the dummy node does not have a left child:
        * Add the value of the dummy node to the vector.
        * Set the dummy node to the dummy node's right child.
    * Otherwise:
        * Add the value of the dummy node to the vector.
        * Set `chkRight` to the dummy node's left child.
        * While `chkRight` has a right child:
            * Set `chkRight` to `chkRight`'s right child.
        * Set `chkRight`'s right child to the dummy node's right child.
        * Set the dummy node's left child to null.
        * Set the dummy node's right child to null.
        * Set the dummy node to `chkRight`.

The algorithm terminates when the dummy node is null, which means that we have reached the end of the tree. The vector that was created will contain the values of the nodes in the preorder traversal.
```cpp
    vector<int> preorderTraversal(TreeNode* root) {
        if(!root) return {};
        
        vector<int> values;

        TreeNode *dummy = root;
        while(dummy){
            if(!dummy->left){
                values.push_back(dummy->val);
                dummy = dummy->right;
            }else{
                values.push_back(dummy->val);
                TreeNode *chkRight = dummy->left;
                
                while(chkRight->right)
                    chkRight = chkRight->right;

                chkRight->right = dummy->right;

                chkRight = dummy->left;
                dummy->left = NULL;
                dummy->right = NULL;
                dummy = chkRight;
            }
        }
        return values;
    }
```
**Here is a more detailed explanation of the algorithm:**

* The first step, creating a vector to store the values of the nodes in the preorder traversal, is necessary because we need to store the values of the nodes as we visit them.
* The second step, creating a dummy node and setting it to the root node, is necessary because we need a way to start the traversal.
* The third step, the while loop that iterates until the dummy node is null, is where the actual traversal takes place. We check if the dummy node has a left child. If it does not, then we add the value of the dummy node to the vector and move on to the right child. Otherwise, we add the value of the dummy node to the vector, set `chkRight` to the dummy node's left child, and then follow the rightmost path in the left subtree.
* The fourth step, the while loop that iterates until `chkRight` has no right child, is necessary to ensure that we visit all of the nodes in the left subtree.
* The fifth step, setting `chkRight`'s right child to the dummy node's right child, is necessary to restore the original structure of the tree.
* The sixth step, setting the dummy node's left child to null and the dummy node's right child to null, is necessary to prepare for the next iteration of the while loop.

### A Iterative Approach using Stack

The code you provided implements the preorder traversal of a binary tree using a stack. The algorithm works as follows:

1. Create a stack and push the root node of the tree onto the stack.
2. While the stack is not empty:
    * Pop the top node from the stack and print its value.
    * If the popped node has a right child, push the right child onto the stack.
    * If the popped node has a left child, push the left child onto the stack.

This algorithm works by recursively visiting the left subtree of the current node before visiting the right subtree. This ensures that the nodes are visited in the order (root, left, right).
```cpp
    vector<int> preorderTraversal(TreeNode* root) {
        if(!root)   return {};
        vector<int> values;
        stack<TreeNode *> st;
        st.push(root);

        while(!st.empty()){
            root = st.top();
            st.pop();
            
            values.push_back(root->val);

            if(root->right)
                st.push(root->right);

            if(root->left)
                st.push(root->left);
        }

        return values;
    }
```
**Here is a more detailed explanation of the algorithm:**

* The first step, creating a stack and pushing the root node onto the stack, is necessary to initialize the algorithm.
* The second step, the while loop that iterates until the stack is empty, is where the actual traversal takes place. We pop the top node from the stack, print its value, and then push its right child and left child onto the stack, if they exist.
* The third step, the if statements that check if the node has a right child or a left child, are necessary to ensure that we visit all of the nodes in the tree.

This algorithm is a simple and efficient way to traverse a binary tree in preorder. It can be easily modified to traverse the tree in other orders, such as inorder or postorder.
