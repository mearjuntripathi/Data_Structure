# [219. Contains Duplicate II](https://leetcode.com/problems/contains-duplicate-ii/)

Given an integer array nums and an integer `k`, return `true` if there are two **distinct indices** `i` and `j` in the array such that `nums[i] == nums[j]` and `abs(i - j) <= k`.

**Example 1:**

> **Input:** nums = [1,2,3,1], k = 3<br>
**Output:** true

**Example 2:**

> **Input:** nums = [1,0,1,1], k = 1<br>
**Output:** true

**Example 3:**

> **Input:** nums = [1,2,3,1,2,3], k = 2<br>
**Output:** false
 
**Constraints:**
- `1 <= nums.length <= 105`
- `-109 <= nums[i] <= 109`
- `0 <= k <= 105`

# Solution

The approach used in the given code is to use a hash table to store the elements of the array and their indices. When a new element is encountered, we check if the hash table already contains the element. If it does, and the difference between the current index and the index of the previous occurrence of the element is less than or equal to `k`, then we return `true`. Otherwise, we insert the new element and its index into the hash table.

Here is a more detailed explanation of the algorithm:

1. Initialize a hash table `mp` to store the elements of the array and their indices.
2. Iterate over the array `nums`.
    * For each element `nums[i]`:
        * If `mp.count(nums[i])` is greater than zero, then the element has already been encountered in the array.
            * If `abs(i - mp[nums[i]]) <= k`, then the two occurrences of the element are within `k` positions of each other, so we return `true`.
        * Otherwise, we insert the element and its index into the hash table.
3. If we reach the end of the array without returning `true`, then there are no duplicate elements within `k` positions of each other, so we return `false`.

```cpp
bool containsNearbyDuplicate(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
    unordered_map<int, int> mp;
    for(int i = 0 ; i < nums.size() ; i++){
        if(mp.count(nums[i]))
            if(abs(i - mp[nums[i]]) <= k)
                return true;
   
        mp[nums[i]] = i;
    }
    return false;
}
```

Here is an example of how the algorithm works:

```
Input: nums = [1, 2, 3, 1], k = 2

1. Initialize the hash table `mp` to be empty.
2. Iterate over the array `nums`:
    * For `nums[0] = 1`:
        * `mp.count(1) == 0`, so we insert `1` and `0` into the hash table.
    * For `nums[1] = 2`:
        * `mp.count(2) == 0`, so we insert `2` and `1` into the hash table.
    * For `nums[2] = 3`:
        * `mp.count(3) == 0`, so we insert `3` and `2` into the hash table.
    * For `nums[3] = 1`:
        * `mp.count(1) == 1`, and `abs(3 - mp[1]) <= k`, so we return `true`.
3. We never reach the end of the array, so we never return `false`.

Output: true
```

The time complexity of the algorithm is O(n), where `n` is the size of the array. This is because we iterate over the array once. The space complexity of the algorithm is O(n), since we need to store the elements of the array in the hash table.

## Pros and Cons of the Approach

The following are the pros and cons of the approach used in the given code:

**Pros:**

* Simple to understand and implement.
* Efficient for both small and large arrays.

**Cons:**

* Requires O(n) space to store the elements of the array in the hash table.

## Conclusion

The approach used in the given code is an efficient way to solve the problem of finding duplicate elements within `k` positions of each other in an array. It is simple to understand and implement, and it is efficient for both small and large arrays.
