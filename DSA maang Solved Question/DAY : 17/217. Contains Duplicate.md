# [217. Contains Duplicate](https://leetcode.com/problems/contains-duplicate/)

Given an integer array `nums`, return `true` if any value appears at least twice in the array, and return `false` if every element is distinct.

 

**Example 1:**

> **Input:** nums = [1,2,3,1]<br>
**Output:** true

**Example 2:**

> **Input:** nums = [1,2,3,4]<br>
**Output:** false

**Example 3:**

> **Input:** nums = [1,1,1,3,3,4,3,2,4,2]<br>
**Output:** true
 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 105`
- `-109 <= nums[i] <= 109`

# Solution

The approach used in the given code is to use a hash table to store the frequency of each element in the array. If any element has a frequency greater than 1, then that means that there is a duplicate element in the array.

The algorithm works as follows:

1. Initialize a hash table `mp`.
2. Iterate over the input array `nums`.
    * For each element `num` in the array, increment the corresponding frequency in the hash table `mp`.
3. If any element in the hash table has a frequency greater than 1, then return `true`. Otherwise, return `false`.

```cpp
bool containsDuplicate(vector<int>& nums) {
    unordered_map<int,int> mp;
    for(auto num : nums){
        if(mp[num]++ != 0)
            return true;
    }
    return false;
}
```

Here is a step-by-step example of how the algorithm works:

```
Input: nums = [1, 2, 3, 1]

1. mp = {}
2. Iterate over the input array `nums`:
    * num = 1: mp[1]++ = 1
    * num = 2: mp[2]++ = 1
    * num = 3: mp[3]++ = 1
    * num = 1: mp[1]++ = 2
3. Since mp[1] > 1, return `true`.
```

## Time and Space Complexity

The time complexity of the algorithm is O(n), where `n` is the size of the input array. This is because the algorithm iterates over the input array once to build the hash table, and then iterates over the hash table once to check for duplicates.

The space complexity of the algorithm is also O(n), since the algorithm must store the hash table.

## Conclusion

The given code is a simple and efficient way to check if an array contains duplicate elements. It uses a hash table to store the frequency of each element in the array, and then checks if any element has a frequency greater than 1.
