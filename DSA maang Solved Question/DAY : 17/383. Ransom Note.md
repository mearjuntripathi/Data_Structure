# [383. Ransom Note](https://leetcode.com/problems/ransom-note/)

Given two strings `ransomNote` and `magazine`, return `true` if `ransomNote` can be constructed by using the letters from `magazine` and `false` otherwise.

Each letter in `magazine` can only be used once in `ransomNote`.

**Example 1:**

> **Input:** ransomNote = "a", magazine = "b"<br>
**Output:** false

**Example 2:**

> **Input:** ransomNote = "aa", magazine = "ab"<br>
**Output:** false

**Example 3:**

> **Input:** ransomNote = "aa", magazine = "aab"<br>
**Output:** true

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= ransomNote.length, magazine.length <= 105`
- `ransomNote` and `magazine` consist of lowercase English letters.

# Solution

The approach of the given code is to use a hash table to count the frequency of each character in the magazine string. Then, the code iterates over the ransom note string and checks if each character has a non-zero frequency in the hash table. If any character in the ransom note string has a zero frequency in the hash table, then the code returns false. Otherwise, the code returns true.

Here is a more detailed explanation of the algorithm:

1. The code initializes a hash table `mp` with 26 entries, one for each letter in the alphabet.
2. The code iterates over the magazine string and increments the corresponding entry in the hash table for each character.
3. The code iterates over the ransom note string and checks if each character has a non-zero frequency in the hash table.
4. If any character in the ransom note string has a zero frequency in the hash table, then the code returns false.
5. Otherwise, the code returns true.

```cpp
bool canConstruct(string &ransomNote, string &magazine) {

    if(ransomNote.size() > magazine.size())
        return false;

    short mp[26] = {0};
    
    for(char ch : magazine)
        mp[ch-'a']++;
    
    for(char ch : ransomNote)
        if(mp[ch-'a']-- == 0)
            return false;
    
    return true;
}
```


Here is a step-by-step example of how the code works:

```
Input: ransomNote = "aa", magazine = "aab"

1. mp = {0: 0, 1: 1, 2: 1, 3: 0, 4: 0, ..., 25: 0}
2. for ch in magazine:
    mp[ch - 'a'] += 1
    # mp = {0: 0, 1: 2, 2: 1, 3: 0, 4: 0, ..., 25: 0}
3. for ch in ransomNote:
    if mp[ch - 'a'] == 0:
        return False
    mp[ch - 'a'] -= 1
    # mp = {0: 0, 1: 1, 2: 0, 3: 0, 4: 0, ..., 25: 0}
4. return True
```

The time complexity of the code is O(n), where n is the length of the magazine string. This is because the code iterates over the magazine string once and the ransom note string once. The space complexity of the code is O(1), since the hash table has a fixed size of 26 entries.

## Conclusion

The given code is a simple and efficient way to check if a ransom note can be constructed from a magazine. The code uses a hash table to count the frequency of each character in the magazine string, and then checks if each character in the ransom note string has a non-zero frequency in the hash table.
