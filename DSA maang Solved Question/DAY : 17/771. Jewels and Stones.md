# [771. Jewels and Stones](https://leetcode.com/problems/jewels-and-stones/)

You're given strings `jewels` representing the types of stones that are `jewels`, and `stones` representing the `stones` you have. Each character in `stones` is a type of stone you have. You want to know how many of the `stones` you have are also jewels.

Letters are case sensitive, so `"a"` is considered a different type of stone from `"A"`.

**Example 1:**

> **Input:** jewels = "aA", stones = "aAAbbbb"<br>
**Output:** 3

**Example 2:**

> **Input:** jewels = "z", stones = "ZZ"<br>
**Output:** 0
 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= jewels.length, stones.length <= 50`
- `jewels` and `stones` consist of only English letters.
- All the characters of `jewels` are **unique**.

# Solution

The approach of the code is to use a hash table to store the jewels. The algorithm is as follows:

1. Create a hash table `mp` and initialize it to empty.
2. Iterate over the jewels string `jewels` and insert each jewel into the hash table `mp`.
3. Iterate over the stones string `stones` and check if each stone is in the hash table `mp`. If it is, then increment the count variable `value`.
4. Return the count variable `value`.

Here is a more detailed explanation of the algorithm:

1. The `unordered_map` data structure is a hash table that stores key-value pairs. The keys are unique and the values can be anything. In this case, the keys are the jewels and the values are integers.
2. The `insert()` method of the `unordered_map` data structure inserts a new key-value pair into the hash table. If the key already exists, then the value is updated.
3. The `count()` method of the `unordered_map` data structure returns the number of times a given key appears in the hash table.
4. The `increment()` operator (`++`) increments the value of a variable by 1.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int numJewelsInStones(string &jewels, string &stones) {
        unordered_map<char,int> mp;
        for(auto jewel : jewels){
            mp[jewel] = 1;
        }
        int value = 0;
        for(auto stone : stones){
            if(mp.count(stone))
                value++;
        }
        return value;
    }
};
```

Here is an example of how the algorithm works:

```
Input: jewels = "aA", stones = "aAAbbbb"

1. mp = {}
2. mp['a'] = 1, mp['A'] = 1
3. value = 0
    for stone in stones:
        if stone in mp:
            value += 1
        else:
            continue
4. value = 3
```

## Pros and Cons of the Hash Table Approach

The following are the pros and cons of the hash table approach to the `numJewelsInStones()` problem:

**Pros:**

* Efficient for large arrays.
* Uses O(k) space, where `k` is the number of jewels.

**Cons:**

* More complex to understand and implement than the brute force approach.

## Conclusion

The hash table approach is a more efficient way to solve the `numJewelsInStones()` problem than the brute force approach. It uses O(k) space, where `k` is the number of jewels, and it has a time complexity of O(n), where `n` is the length of the stones string.
