# [1207. Unique Number of Occurrences](https://leetcode.com/problems/unique-number-of-occurrences/)

Given an array of integers `arr`, return true if the number of occurrences of each value in the array is **unique** or `false` otherwise.

**Example 1:**

> **Input:** arr = [1,2,2,1,1,3]<br>
**Output:** true<br>
**Explanation:** The value 1 has 3 occurrences, 2 has 2 and 3 has 1. No two values have the same number of occurrences.

**Example 2:**

> **Input:** arr = [1,2]<br>
**Output:** false

**Example 3:**

> **Input:** arr = [-3,0,1,-3,1,1,1,-3,10,0]<br>
**Output:** true
 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= arr.length <= 1000`
- `-1000 <= arr[i] <= 1000`

# Solution

The code I provided has two approaches to solving the problem:

**Hash map approach:**

1. Create a hash map to store the frequency of each element in the array.
2. Iterate over the hash map and check if any element has a frequency that has already occurred.
3. If any element has a frequency that has already occurred, return `false`.
4. Otherwise, return `true`.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool uniqueOccurrences(vector<int>& arr) {
        // hash map
        unordered_map<int,int>mp,test;
        for(int n : arr)
            mp[n]++;
        
        for(auto m : mp)
            if(test[m.second]++ > 0)
                return false;
        
        return true;

    }
};
```

**Sorting algorithm:**

1. Sort the array in ascending order.
2. Create a new vector to store the frequency of each element.
3. Iterate over the sorted array and keep track of the current element and its count.
4. When the current element changes, add the count of the previous element to the new vector.
5. Sort the new vector in ascending order.
6. Iterate over the sorted vector and check if any element has a frequency that has already occurred.
7. If any element has a frequency that has already occurred, return `false`.
8. Otherwise, return `true`.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool uniqueOccurrences(vector<int>& arr) {
        // sorting algo
        int i = 0;
        sort(arr.begin(), arr.end());

        vector<int> ans;
        while(i < arr.size()){
            int count = 1;
            
            for(int j = i+1 ; j < arr.size() ; j++)
                if(arr[i] == arr[j])
                    count++;
        
            ans.push_back(count);
            i += count;
        }

        sort(ans.begin(), ans.end());
        for(i = 0 ; i < ans.size() - 1 ; i++)
            if(ans[i] == ans[i+1])
                return false;
        
        return true;
    }
};
```

**Example:**

```
Input: arr = [1,2,2,1,1,3]
Output: true

Explanation:
The frequency of each element is:
[1,2,3]
[3,1,1]

The frequency of each element is unique, so the output is `true`.
```

**Algorithm analysis:**

**Hash map approach:**

* Time complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the array.
* Space complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the array.

**Sorting algorithm:**

* Time complexity: O(n log n), where n is the length of the array.
* Space complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the array.

**Conclusion:**

The hash map approach is more efficient than the sorting algorithm for both time and space complexity.
