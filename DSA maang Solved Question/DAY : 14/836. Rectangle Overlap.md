# [836. Rectangle Overlap](https://leetcode.com/problems/rectangle-overlap/)

An axis-aligned rectangle is represented as a list `[x1, y1, x2, y2]`, where (`x1`, `y1`) is the coordinate of its bottom-left corner, and (`x2`, `y2`) is the coordinate of its top-right corner. Its top and bottom edges are parallel to the X-axis, and its left and right edges are parallel to the Y-axis.

Two rectangles overlap if the area of their intersection is positive. To be clear, two rectangles that only touch at the corner or edges do not overlap.

Given two axis-aligned rectangles `rec1` and `rec2`, return `true` if they *overlap*, otherwise return `false`.

 

**Example 1:**

> **Input:** rec1 = [0,0,2,2], rec2 = [1,1,3,3]<br>
**Output:** true

**Example 2:**

> **Input:** rec1 = [0,0,1,1], rec2 = [1,0,2,1]<br>
**Output:** false

**Example 3:**

> **Input:** rec1 = [0,0,1,1], rec2 = [2,2,3,3]<br>
**Output:** false
 

**Constraints:**

- `rec1.length == 4`
- `rec2.length == 4`
- `-109 <= rec1[i], rec2[i] <= 109`
- `rec1` and `rec2` represent a valid rectangle with a non-zero area.

# Solution
The given code is a function called `isRectangleOverlap()` that takes two vectors of integers as > inputand returns a boolean value indicating whether the two rectangles overlap.

The code has three different approaches, but they all essentially do the same thing. They all check to see if any of the following conditions are met:

* The two rectangles do not share any common x-coordinates.
* The two rectangles do not share any common y-coordinates.
* The two rectangles are completely contained within each other.

If any of these conditions are met, then the two rectangles do not overlap and the function returns false. Otherwise, the function returns true.

Here is a more detailed explanation of the code:

```cpp
bool isRectangleOverlap(vector<int>& rec1, vector<int>& rec2) {
         // Approach 1
        // if(rec1[0] == rec1[2] || rec1[1] == rec1[3] ||
        //    rec2[0] == rec2[2] || rec2[1] == rec2[3])
        //     return false;
        
        // return !(rec1[2] <= rec2[0] ||
        //          rec1[3] <= rec2[1] ||
        //          rec1[0] >= rec2[2] ||
        //          rec1[1] >= rec2[3]);

         // Approach 2
        // return (min(rec1[2],rec2[2]) > max(rec1[0],rec2[0]) &&
        //         min(rec1[3],rec2[3]) > max(rec1[1],rec2[1]));
        
        // Approach 3
        if (rec1[1] >= rec2[3] || rec2[1] >= rec1[3] || rec1[0] >= rec2[2] || rec2[0] >= rec1[2]) 
            return false;
        return true;
    }
```

**Approach 1**

This approach checks for the following conditions:

* Either rectangle has a zero width or height.
* The two rectangles do not share any common x- or y-coordinates.

If any of these conditions are met, then the function returns false. Otherwise, the function returns true.

**Approach 2**

This approach checks for the following condition:

* The two rectangles share at least one common x-coordinate and at least one common y-coordinate.

If this condition is met, then the function returns true. Otherwise, the function returns false.

**Approach 3**

This approach checks for the following conditions:

* The bottom edge of rectangle 1 is above the top edge of rectangle 2.
* The bottom edge of rectangle 2 is above the top edge of rectangle 1.
* The left edge of rectangle 1 is to the right of the right edge of rectangle 2.
* The left edge of rectangle 2 is to the right of the right edge of rectangle 1.

If any of these conditions are met, then the function returns false. Otherwise, the function returns true.

All three approaches are correct and efficient. The best approach to use will depend on the specific needs of the application.
