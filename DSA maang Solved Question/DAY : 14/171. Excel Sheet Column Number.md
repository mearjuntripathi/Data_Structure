# [171. Excel Sheet Column Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/excel-sheet-column-number/)

Given a string `columnTitle` that represents the column title as appears in an Excel sheet, return its corresponding column number.

For example:

> A -> 1<br>
B -> 2<br>
C -> 3<br>
. . .<br>
Z -> 26<br>
AA -> 27<br>
AB -> 28<br>
. . .
 

**Example 1:**

> **Input:** columnTitle = "A"<br>
**Output:** 1

**Example 2:**

> **Input:** columnTitle = "AB"<br>
**Output:** 28

**Example 3:**

> **Input:** columnTitle = "ZY"<br>
**Output:** 701
 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= columnTitle.length <= 7`
- `columnTitle` consists only of uppercase English letters.
- `columnTitle` is in the range `["A", "FXSHRXW"]`.

# Solution

The approach of the code is to convert the Excel column title to a number by iterating over the column title from left to right and multiplying the value of each character by 26, and then adding the character's value to the total value.

The algorithm of the code is as follows:

1. Initialize a variable `value` to store the total value of the column title.
2. Iterate over the column title string:
    * Multiply `value` by 26.
    * Add the current character's value to `value`.
3. Return the value of `value`.

**Here is a more detailed explanation of the algorithm:**

```cpp
int titleToNumber(string columnTitle) {
        int value = 0;
        for(char ch : columnTitle){
            value *= 26;
            value += ch-'A'+1;
        }
        return value;
    }
```

The code first initializes the variable `value` to store the total value of the column title. Then, the code iterates over the column title string. For each character in the column title string, the code multiplies `value` by 26 and then adds the character's value to `value`. This is because the Excel column title system is base-26, so each character in the column title represents a power of 26.

Once the code has iterated over the entire column title string, the code returns the value of `value`.

Here is an example of how the `titleToNumber()` function would be used:

```cpp
string columnTitle = "A";
int integerValue = titleToNumber(columnTitle);
```

The variable `integerValue` would then contain the value 1, which is the integer equivalent of the Excel column title "A".
