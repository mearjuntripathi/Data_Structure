# [258. Add Digits](https://leetcode.com/problems/add-digits/description/)

Given an integer num, repeatedly add all its digits until the result has only one digit, and return it.

 

**Example 1:**

> **Input**: num = 38<br>
**Output:** 2<br>
**Explanation:** The process is<br>
38 --> 3 + 8 --> 11<br>
11 --> 1 + 1 --> 2 <br>
Since 2 has only one digit, return it.

**Example 2:**

> **Input**: num = 0<br>
**Output:** 0
 

**Constraints:**

- `0 <= num <= 231 - 1`
 

**Follow up:** Could you do it without any loop/recursion in `O(1)` runtime?

# Solution

The approach of the code is to use the following mathematical property:

**Any number is congruent to the sum of its digits modulo 9.**

This means that for any number `n`, we can write:

```
n ≡ n₁ + n₂ + ... + nk (mod 9)
```

where `n₁`, `n₂`, ..., `nk` are the digits of `n`.

The algorithm of the code is as follows:

1. If the number is zero, return 0.
2. Otherwise, divide the number by 9 and return the remainder.
3. If the remainder is zero, return 9.

Here is a more detailed explanation of the algorithm:

```cpp
int addDigits(int num) {
    if(num) return num%9 ? num%9 : 9; 
    return 0;
}
```

The code first checks if the number is zero. If it is, the code returns 0. Otherwise, the code divides the number by 9 and returns the remainder.

If the remainder is zero, the code returns 9. This is because the sum of the digits of any number that is divisible by 9 is also divisible by 9. Therefore, the sum of the digits of any number that is divisible by 9 must be a multiple of 9. The only multiple of 9 that is less than 9 is 0, so the code returns 9 in this case.

Here is a table showing the results of the `addDigits()` function for the numbers 1-9 and 1-45:

| value | number | number | number | number | number |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 1 | 1 + 0 | 1 + 9 | 2 + 8 | 3 + 7 |
| 2 | 2 | 1 + 1 | 2 + 0 | 2 + 9 | 3 + 8 |
| 3 | 3 | 1 + 2 | 2 + 1 | 3 + 0 | 3 + 9 |
| 4 | 4 | 1 + 3 | 2 + 2 | 3 + 1 | 4 + 0 |
| 5 | 5 | 1 + 4 | 2 + 3 | 3 + 2 | 4 + 1 |
| 6 | 6 | 1 + 5 | 2 + 4 | 3 + 3 | 4 + 2 |
| 7 | 7 | 1 + 6 | 2 + 5 | 3 + 4 | 4 + 3 |
| 8 | 8 | 1 + 7 | 2 + 6 | 3 + 5 | 4 + 4 |
| 9 | 9 | 1 + 8 | 2 + 7 | 3 + 6 | 4 + 5 |


As you can see, the `addDigits()` function returns the same value for all numbers that have the same sum of digits.
