# [1523. Count Odd Numbers in an Interval Range](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-odd-numbers-in-an-interval-range/description/)
Given two non-negative integers `low` and `high`. Return the count of odd numbers between `low` and `high` (*inclusive*).

 

**Example 1:**

> **Input:** low = 3, high = 7<br>
**Output:** 3<br>
**Explanation:** The odd numbers between 3 and 7 are [3,5,7].

**Example 2:**

> **Input:** low = 8, high = 10<br>
**Output:** 1<br>
**Explanation:** The odd numbers between 8 and 10 are [9].
 

**Constraints:**

- `0 <= low <= high <= 10^9`

# Solution

The approach of the code is to check if the lower and upper bounds are odd or even. If they are both odd or both even, then the number of odd numbers between them is simply the difference between the upper and lower bounds divided by two. However, if the lower bound is odd and the upper bound is even, or vice versa, then there is one additional odd number between them.

The algorithm of the code is as follows:

1. Check if the lower and upper bounds are odd or even.
2. If they are both odd or both even, then return the difference between the upper and lower bounds divided by two.
3. Otherwise, return the difference between the upper and lower bounds divided by two, plus one.

Here is a more detailed explanation of the algorithm:

```cpp
int countOdds(int low, int high) {
    if(low%2 || high %2) return ((high - low)/2)+1;
    
    return (high - low) / 2;
}
```

The code first checks if the lower and upper bounds are odd or even using the modulo operator (`%`). The modulo operator returns the remainder of a division operation. For example, `10 % 2 = 0` because 10 divided by 2 has no remainder. However, `9 % 2 = 1` because 9 divided by 2 has a remainder of 1.

If the lower and upper bounds are both odd or both even, then the number of odd numbers between them is simply the difference between the upper and lower bounds divided by two. This is because the difference between two even numbers is always even, and the difference between two odd numbers is always odd.

However, if the lower bound is odd and the upper bound is even, or vice versa, then there is one additional odd number between them. This is because the difference between an odd number and an even number is always odd.

**Here is an example of how the `countOdds()` function would be used:**

```cpp
Solution solution;
int numberOfOddNumbers = solution.countOdds(1, 10);
```

The variable `numberOfOddNumbers` would then contain the value 5, which is the number of odd numbers between 1 and 10.

Here is another example:

```cpp
Solution solution;
int numberOfOddNumbers = solution.countOdds(2, 10);
```

The variable `numberOfOddNumbers` would then contain the value 4, which is the number of odd numbers between 2 and 10.
