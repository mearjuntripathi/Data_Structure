# [388. Longest Absolute File Path](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-absolute-file-path/)

Suppose we have a file system that stores both files and directories. An 
**example of** one system is represented in the following picture:

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/08/28/mdir.jpg)

Here, we have `dir` as the only directory in the root. `dir` contains two subdirectories, `subdir1` and `subdir2`. `subdir1` contains a file `file1.ext` and subdirectory `subsubdir1`. `subdir2` contains a subdirectory `subsubdir2`, which contains a file `file2.ext`.

In text form, it looks like this (with ⟶ representing the tab character):

dir
>⟶ subdir1<br>
>⟶ ⟶ file1.ext<br>
>⟶ ⟶ subsubdir1<br>
>⟶ subdir2<br>
>⟶ ⟶ subsubdir2<br>
>⟶ ⟶ ⟶ file2.ext

If we were to write this representation in code, it will look like this: `"dir\n\tsubdir1\n\t\tfile1.ext\n\t\tsubsubdir1\n\tsubdir2\n\t\tsubsubdir2\n\t\t\tfile2.ext"`. Note that the `'\n'` and `'\t'` are the new-line and tab characters.

Every file and directory has a unique absolute path in the file system, which is the order of directories that must be opened to reach the file/directory itself, all concatenated by '/'s. Using the above example, the absolute path to `file2.ext` is `"dir/subdir2/subsubdir2/file2.ext"`. Each directory name consists of letters, digits, and/or spaces. Each file name is of the form `name.extension`, where `name` and `extension` consist of letters, digits, and/or spaces.

Given a string `input` representing the file system in the explained format, return the length of the longest absolute path to a file in the abstracted file system. If there is no file in the system, return `0`.

Note that the testcases are generated such that the file system is valid and no file or directory name has length 0.

 


**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/08/28/dir1.jpg)

>**Input:** input = "dir\n\tsubdir1\n\tsubdir2\n\t\tfile.ext"<br>
**Output:** 20<br>
**Explanation:** We have only one file, and the absolute path is "dir/subdir2/file.ext" of length 20.

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/08/28/dir2.jpg)

>**Input:** input = "dir\n\tsubdir1\n\t\tfile1.ext\n\t\tsubsubdir1\n\tsubdir2\n\t\tsubsubdir2\n\t\t\tfile2.ext"<br>
**Output:** 32<br>
**Explanation:** We have two files:<br>
"dir/subdir1/file1.ext" of length 21<br>
"dir/subdir2/subsubdir2/file2.ext" of length 32.<br>
We return 32 since it is the longest absolute path to a file.

**Example 3:**

>**Input:** input = "a"<br>
**Output:** 0<br>
**Explanation:** We do not have any files, just a single directory named "a".
 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= input.length <= 1e4`
- `input` may contain lowercase or uppercase English letters, a new line character `'\n'`, a tab character `'\t'`, a dot `'.'`, a space `' '`, and digits.
- All file and directory names have positive length.

# Solution
This solution to the Longest Path in a Directory Tree problem uses a stack to keep track of the current directory level.

**Algorithm:**

1. Initialize a stack and push the root directory level (0) onto it.
2. Initialize a variable `res` to 1 to represent the length of the longest path.
3. Initialize a variable `i` to 0 to keep track of the current index in the input string.
4. While `i` is less than the length of the input string:
    * Get the current directory level from the stack.
    * Calculate the length of the current path by adding the current directory level to the length of the current file or directory name.
    * If the current file or directory name is a file, update `res` to the maximum of `res` and the current path length.
    * If the current file or directory name is a directory:
        * Push the current path length onto the stack.
        * Increment `i` to skip the newline character.
        * While `i` is less than the length of the input string and the current character is a tab character:
            * Increment `i`.
            * Increment the current directory level.
5. Pop all the directory levels from the stack.
6. Return `res - 1` to exclude the root directory level.

Here is a C++ implementation of the algorithm:

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int lengthLongestPath(string input) {
        stack<int> st;
        st.push(0);
        int res = 1, i = 0, n = input.size();
        while(i < n){
            int curr = 0;
            while(i < n && input[i] != '\n' && input[i] != '.'){
                i++;
                curr++;
            }
            if(input[i] == '.'){
                while(i<n && input[i] != '\n'){
                    i++;
                    curr++;
                }
                res = max(res,st.top() + curr + 1);
            }
            st.push(st.top()+curr+1);
            i++;
            int level = 1;
            while(i < n && input[i] == '\t'){
                i++;
                level++;
            }
            while(level + 1 <= st.size())
                st.pop();
        }
        return res - 1;
    }
};
```

This C++ implementation of the algorithm is time-efficient and space-efficient. It uses O(n) time to iterate over the input string and O(d) space to store the directory levels in the stack, where `d` is the depth of the directory tree.
