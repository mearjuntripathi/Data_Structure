# [71. Simplify Path](https://leetcode.com/problems/simplify-path/)

Given a string `path`, which is an **absolute path** (starting with a slash `'/'`) to a file or directory in a Unix-style file system, convert it to the simplified **canonical path**.

In a Unix-style file system, a period `'.'` refers to the current directory, a double period `'..'` refers to the directory up a level, and any multiple consecutive slashes (i.e. `'//'`) are treated as a single slash `'/'`. For this problem, any other format of periods such as `'...'` are treated as file/directory names.

The **canonical path** should have the following format:

- The path starts with a single slash `'/'`.
- Any two directories are separated by a single slash `'/'`.
- The path does not end with a trailing `'/'`.
- The path only contains the directories on the path from the root directory to the target file or directory (i.e., no period `'.'` or double period `'..'`)

*Return the simplified **canonical path***.

 


**Example 1:**

>**Input:** path = "/home/"<br>
**Output:** "/home"<br>
**Explanation:** Note that there is no trailing slash after the last directory name.

**Example 2:**

>**Input:** path = "/../"<br>
**Output:** "/"<br>
**Explanation:** Going one level up from the root directory is a no-op, as the root level is the highest level you can go.

**Example 3:**

>**Input:** path = "/home//foo/"<br>
**Output:** "/home/foo"<br>
**Explanation:** In the canonical path, multiple consecutive slashes are replaced by a single one.
 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= path.length <= 3000`
- `path` consists of English letters, digits, period `'.'`, slash `'/'` or `'_'`.
- `path` is a valid absolute Unix path.

# Solution
This solution to the Simplify Path problem uses a stack to store the names of the files in the path. The algorithm works as follows:

1. Split the path into a list of strings, using the '/' character as the delimiter.
2. Initialize a stack to store the names of the files in the path.
3. Iterate over the list of strings, starting with the last string.
    * If the current string is ".", ignore it.
    * If the current string is "..", pop a file from the stack.
    * Otherwise, push the current string onto the stack.
4. Initialize a string to store the simplified path.
5. While the stack is not empty, pop a file from the stack and append it to the simplified path, starting from the beginning of the path.
6. Return the simplified path.

Here is the pseudocode for the algorithm in C++:

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    string simplifyPath(string path) {
        stack<string>files;
        for(int i = 0 ; i < path.size() ; i++){
            if(path[i] == '/')
                continue;
            string file;
            while(i < path.size() && path[i] != '/')
                file += path[i++];
            if(file == ".")
                continue;
            if(file == ".."){
                if(!files.empty()) files.pop();
            }else files.push(file);
        }
        path.clear();
        while(!files.empty()){
            path = '/' + files.top() + path;
            files.pop();
        }
        return path == "" ? "/" : path;
    }
};
```

This C++ implementation of the simplify path algorithm is time-efficient and space-efficient. It uses O(n) time to split the path into a list of strings and O(n) space to store the stack of files.
