# [1233. Remove Sub-Folders from the Filesystem](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-sub-folders-from-the-filesystem/)

Given a list of folders `folder`, return the folders after removing all sub-folders in those folders. You may return the answer in any order.

If a `folder[i]` is located within another `folder[j]`, it is called a sub-folder of it.

The format of a path is one or more concatenated strings of the form: `'/'` followed by one or more lowercase English letters.

- For example, `"/leetcode"` and `"/leetcode/problems"` are valid paths while an empty string and `"/"` are not.
 


**Example 1:**

>**Input:** folder = ["/a","/a/b","/c/d","/c/d/e","/c/f"]<br>
**Output:** ["/a","/c/d","/c/f"]<br>
**Explanation:** Folders "/a/b" is a subfolder of "/a" and "/c/d/e" is inside of folder "/c/d" in our filesystem.

**Example 2:**

>**Input:** folder = ["/a","/a/b/c","/a/b/d"]<br>
**Output:** ["/a"]<br>
**Explanation:** Folders "/a/b/c" and "/a/b/d" will be removed because they are subfolders of "/a".

**Example 3:**

>**Input:** folder = ["/a/b/c","/a/b/ca","/a/b/d"]<br>
**Output:** ["/a/b/c","/a/b/ca","/a/b/d"]<br>
 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= folder.length <= 4 * 1e4`
- `2 <= folder[i].length <= 100`
- `folder[i]` contains only lowercase letters and `'/'`.
- `folder[i]` always starts with the character `'/'`.
- Each folder name is unique.

# Solution

Sure, here is an algorithm and approach for removing subfolders from a list of folder paths, along with the corresponding C++ code:

**Algorithm:**

1. **Sort the folder paths:** Sort the list of folder paths in alphabetical order. This will make it easier to identify and compare folder paths.

2. **Initialize an empty result vector:** Create an empty vector to store the filtered folder paths.

3. **Initialize a previous folder path:** Set a variable to store the previous folder path. Initially, set it to the first folder path in the sorted list.

4. **Iterate through the sorted folder paths:** Loop through the sorted folder paths, starting from the second one (since the first one has already been processed).

5. **Check for subfolder relationship:** For each folder path, check if it is a subfolder of the previous folder path. This can be done by comparing the two folder paths from the beginning until the first slash character. If the current folder path is a subfolder of the previous one, skip it.

6. **Add the folder path to the result vector:** If the current folder path is not a subfolder of the previous one, add it to the result vector. This means that it is a valid folder path and should be kept.

7. **Update the previous folder path:** Set the previous folder path to the current folder path. This will be used in the next iteration to check for subfolder relationships.

8. **Return the result vector:** After processing all the folder paths, return the result vector containing the filtered folder paths.

**Approach:**

The approach is to iteratively process the sorted folder paths, checking each one against the previous one to determine if it is a subfolder. If it is a subfolder, it is skipped; otherwise, it is added to the result vector. This ensures that only non-subfolder folder paths are included in the final result.

**C++ Code:**

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    vector<string> removeSubfolders(vector<string>& folder) {
        sort(folder.begin(), folder.end());
        vector<string> res;
        int n = folder.size();
        
        string prev = folder[0];
        res.push_back(prev);
        
        for(int i = 1; i < n; i++)
        {
            string cur = folder[i];
            if (prev == cur) continue;
            if (cur.substr(0, prev.size()) == prev && cur[prev.size()] == '/') continue;
            res.push_back(cur);
            prev = cur;
        }
        
        return res;
    }
};
```

This code implements the described algorithm and approach to remove subfolders from a list of folder paths. It sorts the folder paths, iterates through them, checking for subfolder relationships, and adds non-subfolder paths to the result vector. Finally, it returns the filtered folder paths.
