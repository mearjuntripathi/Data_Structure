# [1268. Search Suggestions System](https://leetcode.com/problems/search-suggestions-system/)

You are given an array of strings `products` and a string `searchWord`.

Design a system that suggests at most three product names from `products` after each character of `searchWord` is typed. Suggested products should have common prefix with `searchWord`. If there are more than three products with a common prefix return the three lexicographically minimums products.

Return a list of lists of the suggested products after each character of `searchWord` is typed.

**Example 1:**

>**Input:** products = ["mobile","mouse","moneypot","monitor","mousepad"], searchWord = "mouse"<br>
**Output:** [["mobile","moneypot","monitor"],["mobile","moneypot","monitor"],["mouse","mousepad"],["mouse","mousepad"],["mouse","mousepad"]]<br>
**Explanation:** products sorted lexicographically = ["mobile","moneypot","monitor","mouse","mousepad"].<br>
After typing m and mo all products match and we show user ["mobile","moneypot","monitor"].<br>
After typing mou, mous and mouse the system suggests ["mouse","mousepad"].

**Example 2:**

>**Input:** products = ["havana"], searchWord = "havana"<br>
**Output:** [["havana"],["havana"],["havana"],["havana"],["havana"],["havana"]]<br>
**Explanation:** The only word "havana" will be always suggested while typing the search word.
 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= products.length <= 1000`
- `1 <= products[i].length <= 3000`
- `1 <= sum(products[i].length) <= 2 * 1e4`
- All the strings of `products` are unique.
- `products[i]` consists of lowercase English letters.
- `1 <= searchWord.length <= 1000`
- `searchWord` consists of lowercase English letters.

# Solution
Sure, here is an algorithm, approach, and code in C++ for the suggestedProducts function:

**Algorithm**

1. Create a Trie data structure to store the products.
2. Insert each product into the Trie.
3. For each prefix of the searchWord, find the corresponding node in the Trie.
4. Perform a depth-first search (DFS) starting from the corresponding node to find all suggestions up to a limit of 3.

**Approach**

The algorithm utilizes a Trie data structure to efficiently search for suggestions based on the prefixes of the searchWord. The Trie allows for quick retrieval of suggestions by traversing down the tree based on the characters of the searchWord. The DFS ensures that all valid suggestions are found within the limit of 3.

**Code**

```c++
class Node {
public:
    Node* words[26];
    bool end;
    string word;

    Node() {
        for (int i = 0; i < 26; i++) {
            words[i] = NULL;
        }
        word = "";
    }
};

class Trie {
public:
    Node* root;

    Trie() {
        root = new Node();
    }

    void insert(string& word) {
        Node* currentNode = root;
        for (auto ch : word) {
            if (!currentNode->words[ch - 'a']) {
                currentNode->words[ch - 'a'] = new Node();
            }
            currentNode = currentNode->words[ch - 'a'];
        }
        currentNode->word = word;
    }

    void dfs(Node* node, int limit, vector<string>& results) {
        if (!node || results.size() == limit) {
            return;
        }

        if (node->word != "") {
            results.push_back(node->word);
        }

        for (int i = 0; i < 26; i++) {
            if (node->words[i]) {
                dfs(node->words[i], limit, results);
            }
        }
    }

    vector<string> suggestProduct(string& str, int limit) {
        vector<string> results;
        Node* currentNode = root;
        for (auto ch : str) {
            if (!currentNode->words[ch - 'a']) {
                return results;
            }
            currentNode = currentNode->words[ch - 'a'];
        }
        dfs(currentNode, limit, results);
        return results;
    }
};

class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<string>> suggestedProducts(vector<string>& products, string searchWord) {
        Trie* trie = new Trie();

        for (auto product : products) {
            trie->insert(product);
        }

        vector<vector<string>> suggestedProducts;
        string search = "";
        for (auto word : searchWord) {
            search += word;
            vector<string> suggestion = trie->suggestProduct(search, 3);
            suggestedProducts.push_back(suggestion);
        }
        return suggestedProducts;
    }
};
```

This code defines a Trie data structure and a function to suggest products based on a searchWord. The main function constructs a Trie from the products list and iterates over the searchWord, generating suggestions for each prefix.
