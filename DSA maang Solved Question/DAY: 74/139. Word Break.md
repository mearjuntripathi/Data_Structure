# [139. Word Break](https://leetcode.com/problems/word-break/)

Given a string `s` and a dictionary of strings `wordDict`, return `true` if `s` can be segmented into a space-separated sequence of one or more dictionary words.

Note that the same word in the dictionary may be reused multiple times in the segmentation.

**Example 1:**

>**Input**: s = "leetcode", wordDict = ["leet","code"]<br>
**Output:** true<br>
**Explanation:** Return true because "leetcode" can be segmented as "leet code".

**Example 2:**

>**Input**: s = "applepenapple", wordDict = ["apple","pen"]<br>
**Output:** true<br>
**Explanation:** Return true because "applepenapple" can be segmented as "apple pen apple".<br>
Note that you are allowed to reuse a dictionary word.

**Example 3:**

>**Input**: s = "catsandog", wordDict = ["cats","dog","sand","and","cat"]<br>
**Output:** false
 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= s.length <= 300`
- `1 <= wordDict.length <= 1000`
- `1 <= wordDict[i].length <= 20`
- `s` and `wordDict[i]` consist of only lowercase English letters.
- All the strings of `wordDict` are unique.

# Solution

Sure, here is an algorithm and approach of the provided code in C++:

**Algorithm:**

The algorithm is designed to determine whether a given string can be formed by concatenating words from a dictionary. It employs a top-down dynamic programming approach to memoize intermediate results and avoid redundant computations.

1. **Initialization:**
   - Create an empty hash table `memo` to store memoization results.

2. **Recursive Function:**
   - Define a recursive function `wordBreak(s, wordDict, idx)` that takes a string `s`, a dictionary `wordDict`, and an index `idx` as input.
   - Check if the result for the current index `idx` has already been computed in the `memo` hash table.
       - If found, return the cached result.
   - Check if the current index `idx` has reached the end of the string `s`.
       - If yes, return `true` indicating that the entire string can be formed using words from the dictionary.
   - Iterate through each word in the dictionary `wordDict`.
       - Find the position `pos` of the current word in the string `s` starting from index `idx`.
       - If the word is found at the current position (`pos == idx`), recursively call `wordBreak(s, wordDict, idx + word.length())` to check if the remaining substring can be formed using words from the dictionary.
           - If the recursive call returns `true`, return `true` indicating that the entire string can be formed.
   - After iterating through all words in the dictionary without finding a match, store `false` in the `memo` hash table for the current index `idx` indicating that no valid word combination exists for this substring.
   - Return `false` indicating that the entire string cannot be formed using words from the dictionary.

```cpp
class Solution {
    unordered_map<int, bool> memo;
public:
    bool wordBreak(string s, std::vector<std::string> &wordDict, int idx = 0)
    {
        //! make it efficient.
        auto it = memo.find(idx);
        if (it != memo.end())
            return it->second;

        //! make it work
        // define basecases.
        if (idx == s.length())
            return true;

        for (auto word : wordDict)
        {
            // search for the position of this word in the string.
            size_t pos = s.find(word, idx);

            if (pos == idx)
                if (wordBreak(s, wordDict, idx + word.length()))
                    return true;
        }
        // this means that we could not formate the string.
        memo[idx] = false;
        return false;
    }
};
```

**Approach:**

The approach utilizes a top-down dynamic programming strategy to solve the problem efficiently. It breaks down the problem into smaller subproblems and stores the solutions to these subproblems in a hash table to avoid repeated computations. This memorization technique significantly improves the algorithm's time complexity, making it suitable for handling larger input strings.

The recursive function `wordBreak` systematically explores all possible word combinations starting from the beginning of the string and checks if the remaining substring can be formed using words from the dictionary. If a valid combination is found, it returns `true`, indicating that the entire string can be formed. If no valid combination is found, it stores `false` in the memoization hash table for the current index and returns `false`, indicating that the remaining substring cannot be formed using words from the dictionary.

The memorization technique ensures that the algorithm does not repeatedly compute the same subproblems, resulting in a significant reduction in time complexity. This makes the algorithm more efficient for handling larger input strings and dictionary sizes.
